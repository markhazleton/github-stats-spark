Here's a technical summary of the WebSpark.HttpClientUtility repository:

WebSpark.HttpClientUtility is a sophisticated .NET HTTP client utility library designed to simplify and enhance HTTP communication in modern .NET applications (versions 8-10). The library provides a comprehensive, drop-in solution for HTTP interactions, offering enterprise-grade features like Polly-based resilience (retry and circuit breaker patterns), intelligent response caching, structured logging with correlation IDs, and built-in OpenTelemetry tracing—all configurable with a single method call. Leveraging dependency injection and modern .NET patterns, the library abstracts away complex HttpClient setup, reducing boilerplate code from 50+ lines to a single configuration method while providing robust observability, error handling, and performance optimization features.

Key technical highlights include:
- Integrated Polly resilience policies
- Configurable in-memory response caching
- Automatic correlation and tracing
- Support for .NET 8 LTS, 9, and 10 (Preview)
- Native AOT and IL trimming compatibility
- Extensive test coverage (237+ unit tests)
- Semantic versioning and long-term support

The library is particularly well-suited for microservices, distributed systems, background workers, and web scraping scenarios where reliable, observable HTTP communication is critical. Its design philosophy emphasizes simplicity, performance, and production-readiness, making it an attractive alternative to manually configured HttpClient setups or more rigid HTTP client libraries.

Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the DecisionSpark repository:

DecisionSpark is an innovative .NET 10 web application that implements a dynamic, conversation-driven decision routing engine designed to guide users through intelligent decision-making processes using minimal, contextually-aware questioning. The system leverages a flexible, config-driven architecture that combines RESTful APIs, Razor Pages web interface, and OpenAI integration to generate intelligent recommendations across various domains by evaluating user responses against configurable rule sets.

The application's core architecture is modular and service-oriented, featuring key components like a Session Store, Routing Evaluator, Trait Parser, and OpenAI-powered Question Generator that work together to create adaptive, context-sensitive decision workflows. It supports multiple question types (text input, single-select, multi-select) and uses JSON-based configuration files to define decision specifications, allowing users to create complex decision trees without modifying code. The system's unique approach involves dynamically generating questions, parsing user responses, and applying intelligent routing logic to recommend optimal outcomes.

Technically, the project is built on .NET 10 with a comprehensive technology stack including Razor Pages for the web interface, Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation, Serilog for structured logging, and optional OpenAI integration for natural language processing. The architecture supports session management, file-based conversation persistence, and a pluggable design that allows easy extension and configuration of decision scenarios.
