The SolidSample repository is an educational C# project designed to demonstrate and illustrate the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, specifically tailored for developers learning software design best practices. Created by Steve "ardalis" Smith as a companion to a Pluralsight course, the repository provides a progressive code example that showcases how to refactor and improve software architecture by applying Single Responsibility (SRP), Open-Closed (OCP), Liskov Substitution (LSP), Interface Segregation (ISP), and Dependency Inversion (DIP) principles. The project is structured with multiple tagged branches corresponding to different stages of SOLID principle implementation, allowing developers to follow along and understand incremental improvements in code design. Implemented using .NET and Visual Studio, the repository serves as both a learning resource and a reference implementation for writing more maintainable, extensible, and modular C# applications. Its primary value lies in providing a practical, step-by-step exploration of SOLID principles, making complex software design concepts more accessible to developers seeking to enhance their object-oriented programming skills.
