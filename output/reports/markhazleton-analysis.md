The repository provides code examples and progressive refactoring techniques that illustrate each of the five SOLID principles: Single Responsibility (SRP), Open-Closed (OCP), Liskov Substitution (LSP), Interface Segregation (ISP), and Dependency Inversion (DIP). Developed using Visual Studio 2019 and primarily written in C#, the project serves as a practical learning tool for developers seeking to understand and apply object-oriented design best practices, with tagged branches representing different stages of principle implementation. The repository is structured to allow developers to follow along with the course, examine incremental improvements in code structure, and learn how to write more maintainable, scalable, and loosely coupled software architectures. By providing concrete code examples and progressive refactoring stages, the project offers a hands-on approach to understanding SOLID principles, making it particularly valuable for intermediate C# developers looking to enhance their software design skills and architectural understanding.
