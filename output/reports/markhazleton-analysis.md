The repository provides a progressive, step-by-step implementation of software design principles, with each branch representing a different stage of refactoring and applying Single Responsibility (SRP), Open-Closed (OCP), Liskov Substitution (LSP), Interface Segregation (ISP), and Dependency Inversion (DIP) principles. Developed using Visual Studio 2019 and targeting .NET developers, the project serves as a practical learning tool for understanding how to write more maintainable, flexible, and scalable object-oriented code by progressively improving a sample application's architecture. The repository's unique value lies in its structured approach to teaching SOLID principles, with tagged branches that allow developers to follow the transformation of code from an initially tightly-coupled design to a more modular and loosely-coupled implementation. Created by Steve "ardalis" Smith, a recognized software design expert, the project not only provides code examples but also serves as an educational resource for developers looking to improve their understanding of software design best practices in C#.
