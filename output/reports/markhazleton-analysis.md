WebSpark.SharedKernel is a comprehensive .NET library designed to simplify Domain-Driven Design (DDD) implementation by providing robust infrastructure for building clean, modular enterprise applications. The library offers a rich set of base classes and utilities for creating type-safe entities, value objects, domain events, and repository abstractions, with strong support for CQRS and MediatR integration. Built primarily in C#, it provides generic implementations for entities with multiple ID type support, implements sophisticated domain event handling, and includes advanced patterns like specification-based repositories and comprehensive logging behaviors. The framework is particularly noteworthy for its flexible, type-safe approach to building complex domain models, offering developers a structured toolkit for implementing clean architecture principles with minimal boilerplate code. It targets .NET developers working on enterprise-level applications who want to implement DDD patterns systematically, with built-in support for guard clauses, domain event dispatching, and extensible repository patterns. The library's design emphasizes type safety, separation of concerns, and providing sensible defaults while maintaining high configurability and adherence to SOLID principles.

Here's a comprehensive technical summary for the Yelp.Api repository:

The Yelp.Api is a C# class library that provides a clean, intuitive wrapper for interacting with Yelp's v3 Fusion API, enabling .NET developers to easily integrate comprehensive local business search and review capabilities into their applications. The library supports full-featured business searches with flexible parameters like geolocation, search terms, result limits, and business status (e.g., open now), allowing developers to retrieve detailed business information across 32 countries with minimal configuration overhead. Built for .NET 6, the library follows a straightforward client-based architecture where developers can instantiate a Yelp API client with an authentication key and perform asynchronous searches using either simple method signatures or advanced SearchRequest objects. The library abstracts away complex HTTP request handling and JSON parsing, providing a developer-friendly interface for accessing Yelp's extensive business dataset through strongly-typed models and async methods. What makes this library particularly valuable is its simplicity and direct alignment with Yelp's API specifications, reducing the typical boilerplate code required for third-party API integrations and enabling rapid development of location-based and local business discovery features. Primary use cases include building local search applications, recommendation engines, travel platforms, and any .NET project requiring rich, up-to-date local business information.
