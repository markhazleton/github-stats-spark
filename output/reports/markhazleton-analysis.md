**Quality**: ❌ License | ❌ Docs

The SolidSample repository is an educational project designed to demonstrate and illustrate the SOLID principles of object-oriented design specifically for C# developers, serving as a companion to a Pluralsight course. Created by Steve "ardalis" Smith, the repository provides a progressive code example that walks through refactoring and applying each of the five SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) across different tagged branches. The project is implemented in C# and targets developers learning advanced software design techniques, with a focus on clean, maintainable, and extensible code architecture. While the repository appears to be primarily an educational resource, it offers practical demonstrations of how to transform procedural or tightly-coupled code into more modular, flexible software designs that adhere to fundamental object-oriented design principles. The repository includes multiple branch points corresponding to each SOLID principle, allowing developers to track the incremental improvements and understand how each principle contributes to better software design. Its unique value lies in providing a concrete, step-by-step learning experience for developers seeking to improve their understanding of software design principles through a hands-on, example-driven approach.
