The key innovations include generics-based HTTP request handling, separation of concerns in client-server communication, and a flexible response content abstraction.

### #46. [SolidSample](https://github.com/markhazleton/SolidSample)

⭐ 0 | 🔱 0 | 📝 C# | 📊 0 commits (90d)

This repository is a sample C# application designed to demonstrate and teach the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, specifically targeting developers learning software design best practices. The project is structured as an educational resource with multiple tagged branches representing different stages of implementing each SOLID principle (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion). While primarily an instructional codebase associated with a Pluralsight course, it serves as a practical reference implementation for understanding how to refactor and structure more maintainable and extensible .NET applications using fundamental software design principles.
