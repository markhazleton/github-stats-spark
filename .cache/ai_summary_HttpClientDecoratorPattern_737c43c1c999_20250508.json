    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the HttpClientDecoratorPattern repository:\n\nThis repository demonstrates an advanced implementation of the Decorator Design Pattern for enhancing HttpClient functionality in .NET, providing a robust framework for adding cross-cutting concerns like telemetry, caching, and circuit breaking to HTTP service interactions. The project showcases a flexible, extensible approach to HTTP client management through the WebSpark.HttpClientUtility NuGet package, which allows developers to incrementally add sophisticated features to HTTP request handling without modifying the core HttpClient implementation. Leveraging modern .NET technologies including ASP.NET Core, C# 12, Razor Pages, and Polly for resilience policies, the repository implements a multi-layered decorator strategy that enables granular control over API interactions, with each decorator (Telemetry, Caching, Circuit Breaking) adding specific capabilities to the base HTTP request service. The architectural design follows SOLID principles, particularly the Open/Closed Principle, by allowing behavior extension through composable decorator classes that wrap the core HttpClient functionality. Targeted at .NET developers working with complex microservice architectures or requiring advanced HTTP client management, this project provides a practical reference implementation for building more resilient, observable, and maintainable HTTP service communication layers.",
