    "ai_summary": "Based on the repository details and README, here's a comprehensive technical summary:\n\nGit Spark is a sophisticated Git repository analytics and reporting tool written in TypeScript, designed to provide in-depth insights into repository commit history and development patterns. The tool generates interactive, self-contained HTML reports with advanced visualizations that analyze contributor activity, code changes, and repository dynamics using raw Git commit data. \n\nKey technical highlights include a flexible CLI and programmatic Node.js API, support for multiple output formats (HTML, JSON, CSV, Markdown), and enterprise-grade reporting features like interactive charts, dark mode, accessibility enhancements, and security-conscious design with strict Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation. The tool offers granular analysis capabilities, including daily activity trends, contributor statistics, file change patterns, and governance metrics, with support for complex filtering options like date ranges, branches, authors, and file path patterns.\n\nArchitecturally, Git Spark leverages TypeScript's strong typing and modern JavaScript ecosystem, targeting Node.js 20.6+ environments. It provides a comprehensive set of analytical tools that transform raw Git commit data into actionable insights, making it particularly valuable for engineering managers, DevOps teams, and project leads seeking to understand repository health, contributor dynamics, and development patterns.\n\nThe project distinguishes itself through its focus on creating interactive, self-contained reports with transparent metric documentation, ensuring that users understand both the capabilities and limitations of Git-based analytics. Its modular design supports extensibility through configuration options and potential future integrations with platforms like Azure DevOps.\n\nRecommended for teams seeking data-driven insights into their software development processes, Git Spark offers a powerful, privacy-conscious approach to repository analytics with an emphasis on usability, performance, and comprehensive visualization.",
