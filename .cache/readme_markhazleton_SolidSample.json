  "value": "# SOLID Principles for C# Developers\n\nA sample application used to demonstrate SOLID principles for the Pluralsight course, [SOLID Principles for C# Developers](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-solid-principles).\n\n## Give a Star! :star:\nIf you like this project please give it a star. Thanks!\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nThe `master` branch shows the *initial* code used in the course. It's the starting point. If you want to follow along, you can Fork this repository or download a ZIP with the code. There are separate tags (and branches for that matter) for each of the 5 principles that you can review or download as well. Here are links you can use to jump to these tagged versions in your browser:\n\n- [SRP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/SRP-START) *This should be basically the same as master but with an older README*\n- [OCP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/OCP-START)\n- [LSP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/LSP-START)\n- [ISP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/ISP-START)\n- [DIP Start](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/tree/DIP-START)\n\nThe sample code was written using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.com/). You can download the free Community edition which should work fine with this code. Alternately, you can use Visual Studio Code or another editor you prefer.\n\n## Reporting Bugs and Asking Questions\n\nPlease use [Issues](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/issues) to report actual bugs in the code. If you have questions, please ask them in the [course discussion forum](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-solid-principles/discussion) or on twitter (mention [@ardalis](https://twitter.com/ardalis)).\n\n## Podcast and Other Resources\n\nIf you found this course helpful here are some other resources you may like:\n\n- [Weekly Dev Tips Podcast](https://www.weeklydevtips.com/) (see also [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1OeiOnqUZHVinzRK5MuHsA))\n- [Clean Architecture Solution Template](https://github.com/ardalis/CleanArchitecture)\n- [Live Coding Streams](https://twitch.tv/ardalis)\n- [Group Mentoring with Ardalis](https://devbetter.com)\n- [Clean Code](https://amzn.to/2FNjh2y) on Amazon\n\n"
