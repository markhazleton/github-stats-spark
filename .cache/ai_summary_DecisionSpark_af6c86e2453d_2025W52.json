    "ai_summary": "Based on the detailed repository information, here's a comprehensive technical summary of DecisionSpark:\n\nDecisionSpark is an innovative .NET 10 web application that implements a dynamic, conversation-driven decision routing engine designed to guide users through intelligent, minimal-question interactions for recommending optimal outcomes. The project leverages a sophisticated, config-driven architecture that combines RESTful APIs, Razor Pages, and intelligent rule evaluation to create adaptive decision-making experiences across various domains. Key technological components include OpenAI integration for natural language processing, JSON-based configuration management, and a modular service-oriented design that supports flexible decision specification loading, session management, and intelligent routing evaluation.\n\nThe system's unique approach lies in its ability to dynamically generate conversational interfaces by parsing JSON configuration files, allowing users to navigate complex decision trees with minimal cognitive load while extracting meaningful insights through intelligent trait parsing and rule-based evaluation. Architecturally, DecisionSpark employs a multi-layered approach with distinct services like SessionStore, RoutingEvaluator, TraitParser, and OpenAIService, enabling extensible and configurable decision-making scenarios without requiring extensive code modifications.\n\nPrimary technologies include .NET 10, C#, Razor Pages, OpenAI API, Serilog for structured logging, and Swagger for API documentation. The project is particularly suited for scenarios requiring adaptive, context-aware decision support, such as recommendation systems, interactive planning tools, and intelligent conversational interfaces across domains like family activity planning, technology stack selection, or personalized guidance workflows.",
