    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nThis repository is a comprehensive .NET library for interacting with Google Maps Web Services API, featuring a modular HttpClientUtility that provides a generalized, type-safe approach to managing HTTP client interactions. The project introduces a minimal API implementation using Fast Endpoints, with a sophisticated HttpClientService that abstracts complex HTTP request handling through generic response containers (HttpResponseContent<T>) and leverages dependency injection via IHttpClientFactory. By decoupling HTTP client management from API-specific mapping, the library offers enhanced modularity, improved resource management, and a flexible architecture for developers seeking robust Google Maps API integration in .NET applications. The implementation emphasizes clean separation of concerns, with a focus on extensibility, type safety, and efficient HTTP request handling, making it particularly valuable for developers building geospatial or location-based .NET applications that require seamless Google Maps API interactions.",
