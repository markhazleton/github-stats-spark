    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nThis GitHub repository is a specialized .NET wrapper for the Google Maps Web Services API, designed to provide a modular and extensible solution for integrating Google Maps functionality into .NET applications. The project introduces a sophisticated HttpClientUtility with generic type support, enabling more flexible and efficient HTTP client management through an abstraction layer that decouples client-side HTTP interactions from API-specific mapping logic. Leveraging modern .NET technologies like Fast Endpoints and implementing advanced patterns such as generics-based HTTP response handling, the library offers developers a robust framework for consuming Google Maps services with improved resource management and code maintainability. The repository's key innovations include a generic HttpResponseContent<T> class for standardized response handling, integration of IHttpClientFactory for optimal HttpClient lifecycle management, and a modular architecture that separates concerns between HTTP communication and API-specific implementations. Targeted primarily at .NET developers working on geospatial applications, mapping services, or projects requiring Google Maps API integration, this library provides a clean, extensible approach to handling web service interactions with enhanced performance and flexibility.",
