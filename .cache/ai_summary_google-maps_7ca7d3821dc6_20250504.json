    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nThis repository is a sophisticated .NET library that provides a robust wrapper for the Google Maps Web Services API, focusing on enhanced modularity and efficient HTTP client management through a custom HttpClientUtility. The project introduces a minimal API implementation using Fast Endpoints, demonstrating a modern approach to API interaction by decoupling HTTP client management from API mapping through generic abstractions and a well-structured HttpResponseContent<T> class. Leveraging C# and designed with advanced architectural patterns, the library offers developers a flexible and maintainable solution for integrating Google Maps web services, with particular emphasis on clean separation of concerns, efficient resource management, and extensible HTTP request handling. The implementation showcases sophisticated techniques like generics, dependency injection, and interface-based design, making it particularly valuable for .NET developers seeking a robust, scalable approach to consuming Google Maps web services. By introducing a standalone HttpClientUtility project and utilizing techniques like IHttpClientFactory, the library provides a template for building resilient, performant API client libraries with clean, modular architecture.",
