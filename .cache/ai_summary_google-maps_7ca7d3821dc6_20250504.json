    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nThis GitHub repository is a comprehensive .NET wrapper for the Google Maps Web Services API, designed to simplify and streamline interactions with Google Maps services through a modular and extensible architecture. The project introduces a sophisticated HttpClientUtility with generic HTTP request handling, leveraging Fast Endpoints for minimal API implementation and implementing advanced HTTP client management strategies using dependency injection and generics. By abstracting away complex HTTP communication patterns, the library provides developers with a robust, type-safe mechanism for consuming Google Maps web services, with particular emphasis on efficient resource management, error handling, and flexible request/response processing. The implementation showcases modern C# development practices, including generic type constraints, interface-based design, and separation of concerns, making it particularly valuable for .NET developers seeking a clean, maintainable approach to integrating Google Maps functionality into their applications. Its unique approach lies in the generic HttpResponseContent<T> design and the decoupled HttpClientService, which offer enhanced flexibility and extensibility compared to traditional API client implementations.",
