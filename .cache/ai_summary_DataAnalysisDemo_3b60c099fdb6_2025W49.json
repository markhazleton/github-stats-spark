    "ai_summary": "Based on the detailed README, here's a comprehensive technical summary:\n\nDataAnalysisDemo is a sophisticated ASP.NET WebForms data analytics web application designed to transform raw CSV data into interactive, visually rich analytical experiences, featuring advanced data processing, visualization, and exploration capabilities. The project leverages a modern technology stack including .NET Framework 4.8, Bootstrap 5, jQuery, and multiple JavaScript libraries (D3.js, C3.js, PivotTable.js) to provide comprehensive data analysis tools with dynamic charting, pivot table generation, and real-time statistical computation. Its architecture emphasizes modularity, with a webpack-based client-side build system, custom parsing libraries, and responsive design that supports multiple chart types, interactive data tables, and extensive client-side data manipulation across various rendering modes and device types. The application distinguishes itself through its comprehensive feature set, including memory-efficient data streaming, advanced filtering, multiple export formats, and a flexible theme system that enables users to explore and understand complex datasets through intuitive, performance-optimized interfaces. Targeted primarily at data analysts, researchers, and business intelligence professionals, the project demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to web-based data visualization by integrating modern web technologies with robust .NET backend processing. The repository represents a sophisticated demonstration of enterprise-grade data analysis capabilities, combining server-side processing with rich, interactive client-side experiences.",
