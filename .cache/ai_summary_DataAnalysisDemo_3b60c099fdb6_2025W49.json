    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the DataAnalysisDemo repository:\n\nThe DataAnalysisDemo (DAWPM) is a sophisticated web-based data analytics application built using ASP.NET WebForms 4.8 with Visual Basic .NET, designed to transform CSV data files into interactive, visually rich analytics platforms with advanced data processing capabilities. The application leverages a modern client-side architecture integrating Bootstrap 5, jQuery, DataTables, and custom JavaScript libraries to provide comprehensive data exploration features including dynamic charting, pivot table analysis, and real-time statistical processing. Its core strengths lie in its memory-efficient data parsing, extensive visualization options (supporting 15+ chart types), and a flexible pivot table engine that enables drag-and-drop data manipulation with multiple aggregation functions and responsive design. The project demonstrates a sophisticated architectural approach by implementing a Webpack-based build system, modular JavaScript architecture, and comprehensive client-side tooling that bridges traditional .NET WebForms with modern web development practices. What sets this project apart is its holistic approach to data analysis, offering not just visualization but deep analytical capabilities with performance monitoring, multiple export formats, and an intuitive, responsive user interface that adapts to various data formats and user needs. The application would be particularly valuable for data analysts, business intelligence professionals, and researchers seeking a flexible, feature-rich platform for exploring and presenting complex datasets with minimal manual configuration.",
