      "message": "Remove LayoutJson from worksheet templates\n\nThis commit removes the JSON validation logic for the `LayoutJson` property in the `WorksheetTemplatesController`, allowing templates to be created and edited without requiring a JSON layout. The input fields for `LayoutJson` have been removed from the `Create.cshtml` and `Edit.cshtml` forms, and its display has been eliminated from the `Details.cshtml` view.\n\nAdditionally, a new foreign key relationship has been established between `Worksheet` and `WorksheetTemplate` in `ApplicationDbContext.cs`, with `DeleteBehavior.SetNull` to handle deletions gracefully. The `LayoutJson` property has been removed from the `WorksheetTemplate` entity, and corresponding migration files have been added to update the database schema.\n\nThe logging service has been updated to log prompt templates directly from the `WorksheetGenerationRequest`, and the `OpenAILlmService` now uses these templates directly. Mapping extensions have also been adjusted to exclude the `LayoutJson` property.",
