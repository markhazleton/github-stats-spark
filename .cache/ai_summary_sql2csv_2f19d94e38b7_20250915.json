    "ai_summary": "SQL2CSV is a comprehensive .NET 9 toolkit designed to streamline SQLite database exploration, transformation, and code generation, offering developers and data professionals a powerful cross-platform CLI and early-stage web interface for database metadata analysis and export. The project provides robust features including SQLite database discovery, table export to CSV, schema reporting in multiple formats (text/JSON/Markdown), and automatic C# DTO class generation, all built with a clean, modular architecture leveraging dependency injection, structured logging, and modern .NET best practices. Architecturally, the solution follows Clean Architecture principles, separating concerns across core library, console, and web application layers, with a focus on extensibility, testability (115 MSTest unit tests), and cross-platform compatibility. Key technical differentiators include parallel processing for database scanning, flexible export options, dynamic table filtering, and a reusable service-based design that enables easy integration and customization. The toolkit is particularly valuable for developers, data analysts, and engineers who need to quickly inspect, transform, or migrate data from SQLite databases while generating type-safe model representations with minimal manual intervention. With planned features like additional export formats and enhanced code generation, SQL2CSV represents a versatile solution for database metadata management and transformation tasks.",
