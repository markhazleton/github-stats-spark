    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nWeb Project Mechanics is a long-standing, custom web content management system (CMS) designed to manage multiple websites through a single MS-Access database, providing a lightweight and integrated solution for web content administration. Developed primarily in Visual Basic .NET and targeting .NET Framework 4.8, the system leverages a standalone architecture with built-in caching mechanisms to enhance performance and reduce external dependencies. The CMS supports multi-site management, allowing users to control content across different websites from a centralized database, and has evolved through multiple technology iterations since its inception in 2001, transitioning from ASP to JSP and ultimately to .NET. Its unique approach lies in its simplicity, self-contained design, and the developer's long-term commitment to maintaining and adapting the system over two decades, making it particularly suitable for small to medium-sized web projects that require a flexible, custom content management solution. The project demonstrates a pragmatic approach to web development, focusing on practical functionality and minimal complexity, and is open-sourced under the MIT license to encourage community contribution and knowledge sharing.",
