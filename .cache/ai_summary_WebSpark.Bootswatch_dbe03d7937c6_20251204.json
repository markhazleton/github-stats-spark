    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nWebSpark.Bootswatch is a sophisticated .NET Razor Class Library designed to simplify and enhance theme management for ASP.NET Core applications by providing seamless integration of Bootswatch themes with advanced dynamic styling capabilities. The library leverages Bootstrap 5 to deliver a comprehensive theming solution that supports multi-framework compatibility (targeting .NET 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0), includes built-in caching mechanisms, and offers dynamic theme switching with light/dark mode support. Architecturally, it implements a robust service-based approach with dependency injection, utilizing tag helpers, extension methods, and a dedicated `StyleCache` service to manage theme resources efficiently, while providing high-performance theme loading and rendering. The project stands out by offering a developer-friendly, production-ready solution for responsive web design with minimal configuration, making it particularly valuable for .NET developers seeking flexible, modern UI theming with minimal overhead. Key technical innovations include automatic theme detection, comprehensive error handling, and a carefully designed dependency management strategy that requires explicit registration of supporting utilities like `HttpClientUtility`.",
