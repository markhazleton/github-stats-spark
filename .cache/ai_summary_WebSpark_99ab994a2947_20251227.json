    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the WebSpark repository:\n\nWebSpark is an ambitious, modular web application suite built with .NET 9 and Bootstrap 5, designed to provide integrated solutions for prompt optimization, recipe management, and quiz creation. The project stands out for its sophisticated spec-driven development workflow, featuring a unique SpecKit command-line toolchain that enforces rigorous specification, planning, risk assessment, and implementation validation processes. The architecture spans eight distinct modular areas (PromptSpark, RecipeSpark, TriviaSpark, WebCMS, GitHubSpark, AsyncSpark, Admin, and Identity), demonstrating a highly scalable and versatile approach to web application development.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Advanced SEO optimization with comprehensive metadata management\n- Structured data implementation using JSON-LD schemas\n- Multi-engine webmaster tools integration\n- Performance monitoring with Web Vitals tracking\n- Automated risk assessment through the innovative `/speckit.critic` command\n- Strict branch protection and specification-driven development workflow\n\nThe project's most notable innovation is its SpecKit workflow, which introduces an adversarial risk assessment process that proactively identifies potential technical, security, and performance issues before implementation. This approach ensures high-quality, well-documented, and thoroughly vetted feature development across the entire application ecosystem.\n\nThe repository represents a sophisticated example of modern web application architecture, combining cutting-edge .NET technologies, comprehensive DevOps practices, and a meticulously structured development methodology that prioritizes quality, security, and maintainability.",
