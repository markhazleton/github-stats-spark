    "ai_summary": "Based on the comprehensive README and repository details, here's a technical summary of WebSpark:\n\nWebSpark is an ambitious, modular web application ecosystem built with .NET 9 and Bootstrap 5, focusing on creating specialized productivity tools across three primary domains: prompt optimization (PromptSpark), recipe management (RecipeSpark), and quiz creation (TriviaSpark). The project distinguishes itself through a meticulously designed spec-driven development workflow called SpecKit, which implements a rigorous multi-stage process for feature specification, implementation, and risk assessment, ensuring high-quality, well-documented software development.\n\nThe architecture is notably scalable, comprising eight distinct modular areas (PromptSpark, RecipeSpark, TriviaSpark, WebCMS, GitHubSpark, AsyncSpark, Admin, and Identity), demonstrating a microservices-inspired approach within a monolithic application. A standout feature is the comprehensive SEO optimization strategy, which includes advanced metadata management, structured data generation, multi-engine webmaster tool integration, and performance monitoring with Web Vitals tracking.\n\nTechnically, the project leverages modern web technologies including ASP.NET Core MVC, with a strong emphasis on automated testing, risk mitigation, and developer productivity. The SpecKit workflow introduces innovative commands like `/speckit.critic`, which performs adversarial risk assessment, automatically detecting potential architectural, security, and performance issues before implementation.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Advanced SEO optimization with 47 automated tests\n- Spec-driven development with comprehensive risk assessment\n- Modular, extensible architecture\n- Multi-tool productivity platform\n- Robust metadata and structured data generation\n- Performance and analytics integration\n\nThe project appears targeted at developers, content creators, and professionals seeking structured tools for prompt engineering, recipe management, and quiz creation, with a strong focus on technical excellence and systematic development practices.",
