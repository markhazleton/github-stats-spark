    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the KeyPressCounter repository:\n\nKeyPressCounter is a sophisticated Windows system utility developed in C# that provides comprehensive monitoring and analysis of user input activities and system performance metrics, running unobtrusively in the system tray. The application leverages native Windows APIs, .NET 10.0, and specialized libraries like SharpHook to capture global keyboard and mouse events, track system resources, and generate detailed performance insights without compromising user privacy. Its architecture integrates multiple monitoring strategies, including global input hooking, Windows Performance Counters, WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation), and real-time data visualization, enabling users to gain deep insights into their computing behavior and system resource utilization. The project stands out through its multi-dimensional approach to system monitoring, offering not just input tracking but also comprehensive system performance metrics, configurable logging, and seamless Windows integration, making it a powerful tool for productivity analysis, system diagnostics, and user behavior understanding. Unique features like idle time filtering, exportable data logs, and a rich system tray interface with extensive configuration options set it apart from traditional monitoring utilities. The application is particularly valuable for professionals, developers, system administrators, and power users seeking granular insights into their computer usage patterns and system performance characteristics.",
