    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the FastEndpointApi repository:\n\nFastEndpointApi is a demonstrative ASP.NET Core API project showcasing the FastEndpoints framework, a lightweight REST API development approach implementing the REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response) pattern for building high-performance, clean, and maintainable web APIs. The project provides a complete Person Management API with full CRUD operations, leveraging FastEndpoints to minimize boilerplate code and promote a clear, modular architectural design. Key technical features include in-memory data persistence, dependency injection, automatic mapping between request/response models, HATEOAS link generation, and integrated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.\n\nThe repository employs a structured approach with dedicated folders for endpoints, services, and static web assets, demonstrating best practices in API design such as separation of concerns and clean code principles. Built using .NET 9.0 and designed for developers looking to streamline API development, the project offers a practical, hands-on example of how FastEndpoints can simplify and enhance API creation compared to traditional ASP.NET Core MVC or Minimal API approaches.\n\nTechnologies and frameworks used include:\n- ASP.NET Core\n- FastEndpoints\n- Swagger/OpenAPI\n- Dependency Injection\n- REPR architectural pattern\n\nTarget users include .NET developers seeking a more efficient and readable approach to building RESTful APIs with reduced complexity and improved maintainability.",
