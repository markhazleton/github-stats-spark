    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary for the PromptSpark.Chat repository:\n\nPromptSpark.Chat is an innovative ASP.NET Core web application that provides a dynamic, interactive workflow management system using real-time communication technologies. The project enables users to navigate multi-step conversational processes through adaptive, state-managed chat interfaces, leveraging SignalR for WebSocket-based real-time interactions and supporting flexible, configurable workflow definitions via JSON. Its core architectural approach emphasizes server-side conversation state management using thread-safe concurrent collections, with optional AI integration for handling complex or unexpected user interactions, making it particularly suitable for creating guided user experiences like interactive tutorials, customer support flows, or decision-tree based applications. The application distinguishes itself by providing a lightweight, extensible framework for creating conversational workflows with built-in persistence, interactive UI components (via Adaptive Cards), and a modular design that allows easy customization of conversation logic and user journeys. Targeting developers and organizations seeking to implement structured, interactive conversational interfaces, PromptSpark.Chat offers a robust solution for building guided interaction experiences with minimal overhead and high configurability.",
