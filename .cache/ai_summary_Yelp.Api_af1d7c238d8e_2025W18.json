    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary for the Yelp.Api repository:\n\nThe Yelp.Api is a lightweight C# class library that provides a robust, developer-friendly interface for consuming Yelp's Fusion API (version 3), enabling .NET developers to easily integrate comprehensive local business search and review data into their applications. The library abstracts the complexities of API interaction by offering a streamlined client implementation that supports flexible search operations, including geolocation-based queries, parameterized searches, and retrieving business information with minimal boilerplate code. Designed for .NET 6 and supporting asynchronous programming patterns, the library allows developers to quickly retrieve business details, search results, and related metadata using a simple, intuitive API client that handles authentication and request construction transparently. The implementation demonstrates a clean separation of concerns, with distinct models for search requests and responses, and provides strong typing and comprehensive parameter configuration options for precise business searches across multiple countries. Particularly noteworthy is its support for advanced search filtering, such as specifying maximum results, geographic constraints, and real-time business availability, making it an efficient solution for developers building location-aware applications in sectors like travel, food services, and local recommendations. The library is primarily targeted at .NET developers seeking a lightweight, performant method to integrate Yelp's extensive business data into their applications with minimal configuration overhead.",
