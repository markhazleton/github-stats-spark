    "ai_summary": "InquirySpark is a .NET 10-based survey and inquiry management system designed with a read-only SQLite database architecture, providing an MVC admin interface for managing survey data and user interactions. The solution is structured across multiple projects (Admin, Repository, Common) and leverages modern .NET technologies like Entity Framework Core 10, ASP.NET Core Identity, and Bootstrap 5 for a comprehensive, modular approach to data management and presentation. Its unique architecture enforces data immutability by using read-only SQLite databases, preventing schema or data mutations while offering a flexible, lightweight persistence mechanism with centralized configuration through custom options configurators and dependency injection. The project emphasizes clean code practices, including nullable reference types, XML documentation, and a CI/CD-friendly build process that integrates npm asset management and automated testing. Targeted at organizations and developers seeking a lightweight, secure, and easily deployable survey management system, InquirySpark provides a robust framework for creating, managing, and analyzing inquiry data with minimal infrastructure overhead.",
