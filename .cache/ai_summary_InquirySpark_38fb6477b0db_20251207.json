    "ai_summary": "InquirySpark is a .NET 10-based survey and inquiry management system designed with a focus on read-only data persistence using SQLite databases, providing an MVC admin interface for managing survey-related content. The solution is structured across multiple projects (Admin, Repository, Common) and leverages modern .NET technologies like Entity Framework Core 10, ASP.NET Core Identity, and Bootstrap 5 for a comprehensive, lightweight survey management experience. Its architecture emphasizes immutability, strict data access controls, and a modular design, with key features including a DataTables-powered admin interface, centralized configuration through dependency injection, and a warning-free, strongly-typed codebase using nullable reference types and XML documentation. The project stands out for its intentional use of read-only SQLite databases, eliminating the need for traditional SQL Server infrastructure and providing a simple, portable data management approach. Targeted at developers and administrators who need a lightweight, configuration-driven survey management system with robust data protection and minimal deployment complexity, InquirySpark offers a modern, streamlined solution for collecting and managing inquiry data with an emphasis on data integrity and clean architectural patterns.",
