    "ai_summary": "Here's a detailed technical summary of the WebSpark.HttpClientUtility repository:\n\nWebSpark.HttpClientUtility is a sophisticated .NET library that provides a comprehensive, opinionated HTTP client utility designed to simplify and enhance HTTP communication in modern .NET applications. The library offers a drop-in replacement for standard HttpClient, integrating enterprise-grade features like Polly-based resilience patterns (retry, circuit breaker), intelligent response caching, structured logging with correlation IDs, and OpenTelemetry tracing\u2014all configurable with a single method call. Leveraging modern .NET 8-10 capabilities, the library abstracts complex HTTP communication patterns, reducing boilerplate code and providing robust, production-ready HTTP client configuration with minimal developer friction.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Comprehensive HTTP client configuration with one-line setup\n- Built-in resilience patterns using Polly\n- Automatic correlation and distributed tracing\n- Intelligent in-memory response caching\n- OpenTelemetry integration\n- Support for .NET 8 LTS, .NET 9, and .NET 10 Preview\n- Designed for microservices, background workers, and web scrapers\n\nThe library stands out by offering a batteries-included approach to HTTP communication, eliminating the need for manual configuration of retry mechanisms, logging, and telemetry while maintaining high performance and flexibility.\n\nArchitectural approach:\n- Dependency injection-friendly\n- Modular design with separate packages for core HTTP utilities and web crawling\n- Supports Native AOT and IL trimming\n- Strict semantic versioning\n- Extensive test coverage (237+ unit tests)\n\nTarget users include .NET developers building microservices, distributed systems, and applications requiring robust, observable HTTP communication with minimal configuration overhead.",
