    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the WebSpark.HttpClientUtility repository:\n\nWebSpark.HttpClientUtility is a sophisticated .NET HTTP client utility library designed to simplify and enhance HTTP communication in modern .NET applications (versions 8-10+). The library provides a drop-in, one-line configuration solution that integrates multiple enterprise-grade features including Polly-based resilience patterns, intelligent response caching, structured logging, OpenTelemetry tracing, and correlation ID management. By abstracting away complex HTTP client setup, it offers developers a high-level, production-ready approach to making HTTP requests with built-in error handling, retry mechanisms, and observability features across microservices, background workers, and web scraping scenarios.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Comprehensive integration with .NET dependency injection\n- Automatic correlation and tracing capabilities\n- Configurable caching and resilience strategies\n- Full OpenTelemetry and structured logging support\n- Native AOT and IL trimming compatibility\n- Extensive test coverage (237+ unit tests)\n- Semantic versioning with long-term support commitment\n\nThe library stands out by dramatically reducing boilerplate code, providing enterprise-ready HTTP communication patterns with minimal configuration, and offering a clean, extensible design that supports modern .NET development practices. It's particularly well-suited for developers building distributed systems, microservices, or applications requiring robust, observable HTTP interactions.",
