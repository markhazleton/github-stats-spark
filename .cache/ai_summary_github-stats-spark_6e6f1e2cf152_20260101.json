    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the github-stats-spark repository:\n\nStats Spark is an advanced GitHub analytics and visualization platform that automatically generates comprehensive insights and visual representations of a developer's GitHub activity and repository performance. The project leverages Python and AI technologies to create detailed SVG visualizations and markdown reports, offering developers and teams a sophisticated tool for tracking coding patterns, repository health, and professional achievements. Key technical features include an intelligent repository ranking algorithm, AI-powered repository analysis using Claude Haiku, automated daily statistics generation via GitHub Actions, and a modular architecture supporting extensive customization through YAML configuration.\n\nThe system employs a multi-dimensional approach to GitHub profile analysis, generating five primary visualization categories: Overview Dashboard, Commit Heatmap, Language Statistics, Streaks & Consistency, and Fun Stats. It implements advanced techniques like smart caching, rate limit handling, and a three-tier fallback mechanism for generating repository summaries, ensuring high-performance and reliable data retrieval across multiple repositories. The project is designed with enterprise-grade considerations, featuring WCAG AA accessible visualizations, comprehensive test coverage, and a flexible, extensible design that supports local CLI testing and seamless GitHub Actions integration.\n\nTechnologically, the project is built on Python 3.11+, with a clear emphasis on modular design, automated workflows, and intelligent data processing. Its unique value proposition lies in transforming raw GitHub activity data into actionable insights, providing developers with a professional, data-driven representation of their coding journey and technical capabilities.",
