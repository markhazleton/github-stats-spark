    "ai_summary": "Here's a technical summary of the KeyPressCounter repository:\n\nKeyPressCounter is a sophisticated Windows system tray utility designed for comprehensive input and system performance monitoring, built using .NET 10.0 and leveraging Windows-native APIs for deep system introspection. The application provides real-time tracking of keyboard and mouse interactions, system performance metrics, and hardware information through a modular architecture that integrates global input hooking (via SharpHook), Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and performance counters to capture detailed system telemetry. Its unique value proposition lies in its ability to silently track user activity and system resources with minimal performance overhead, offering granular insights through a rich graphical interface, extensive logging capabilities, and privacy-focused design that counts interactions without storing specific input content. The application employs advanced techniques like single-instance protection, native idle time detection, and automated logging with configurable intervals, making it a powerful tool for users interested in understanding their computing habits, system performance, and productivity patterns. Architecturally, the project demonstrates a clean separation of concerns, utilizing system tray integration, background processing, and JSON-based configuration management to create a lightweight yet feature-rich monitoring solution. Ideal for system administrators, developers, researchers, and productivity-focused individuals seeking detailed insights into their computer usage and system performance.",
