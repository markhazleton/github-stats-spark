    "ai_summary": "SQL2CSV is a comprehensive .NET 9 toolkit designed to simplify SQLite database exploration, transformation, and code generation, providing developers and data analysts with a powerful cross-platform utility for database introspection and data extraction. The project offers robust CLI and early-stage web interfaces that enable users to discover SQLite databases, export table data to CSV, generate schema reports in multiple formats (text/JSON/Markdown), and automatically create C# data transfer object (DTO) classes from database schemas. Built with modern software engineering principles, the application leverages dependency injection, clean architecture, structured logging, and implements parallel processing for efficient database operations across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Key differentiators include its intelligent database discovery engine, multi-format export capabilities, dynamic table analysis, and a flexible architecture that separates core services from presentation layers, making it extensible and adaptable to various data exploration scenarios. The toolkit is particularly valuable for developers, data engineers, and analysts who need a lightweight, programmable solution for inspecting, migrating, or generating code from SQLite database structures, with a focus on providing a developer-friendly experience through comprehensive CLI options and a progressive web interface.",
