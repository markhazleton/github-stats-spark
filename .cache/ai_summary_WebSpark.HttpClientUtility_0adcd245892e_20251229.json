    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the WebSpark.HttpClientUtility repository:\n\nWebSpark.HttpClientUtility is a sophisticated .NET HTTP client wrapper that simplifies and enhances HTTP communication for .NET 8-10+ applications by providing a drop-in solution for resilient, observable, and feature-rich HTTP interactions. The library integrates multiple enterprise-grade capabilities including Polly-based resilience patterns (retry, circuit breaker), intelligent response caching, automatic correlation ID generation, structured logging, and OpenTelemetry tracing, all configurable through a single method call (`AddHttpClientUtility()`). Built with a focus on microservices and distributed systems, it abstracts complex HTTP client setup by offering a declarative, context-aware approach to making HTTP requests with built-in error handling, telemetry, and performance optimization. The project stands out by dramatically reducing boilerplate code, providing comprehensive observability features, and supporting modern .NET versions with a commitment to long-term support and semantic versioning, making it particularly attractive for developers building resilient, observable distributed systems and microservices.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Leverages .NET dependency injection\n- Integrates Polly for resilience\n- Implements OpenTelemetry tracing\n- Supports intelligent response caching\n- Provides structured logging\n- Designed for .NET 8-10 ecosystem",
