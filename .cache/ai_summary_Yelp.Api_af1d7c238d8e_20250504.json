    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the Yelp.Api repository:\n\nThe Yelp.Api is a lightweight C# class library that provides a clean, intuitive wrapper for Yelp's Fusion API (v3), enabling .NET developers to easily integrate local business search and review functionality into their applications. The library supports robust geolocation-based business searches with flexible parameters like latitude/longitude, search term, maximum results, and filtering options such as open now status, demonstrating a developer-friendly approach to consuming the Yelp API. Built for .NET 6, the library abstracts the complexity of direct API interactions, offering a simple client-based interface that allows developers to quickly retrieve business information and reviews across 32 countries with minimal configuration. The implementation follows a straightforward async programming model, supporting modern .NET development patterns and providing type-safe models for search requests and responses. What makes this library particularly valuable is its streamlined authentication process, which requires only an API key, and its ability to handle complex search scenarios through a flexible `SearchParameters` object. The primary target users are .NET developers building location-based applications, such as restaurant finders, travel guides, or local service recommendation platforms that require comprehensive business data.",
