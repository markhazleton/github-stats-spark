Project now fully aligned with constitution and ready for implementation.\n\n## Analysis Summary\n- Analyzed 3 core artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) against constitution\n- Identified and resolved 16 findings across all severity levels\n- 1 CRITICAL, 4 HIGH, 8 MEDIUM, 3 LOW severity issues fixed\n- Added 10 new tasks for test coverage and validation (117 \u2192 127 tasks)\n\n## Critical Fixes (Constitution Alignment)\n- Updated plan.md constitution check to acknowledge existing constitution.md\n- Added full alignment verification against all 5 constitution principles\n- Restructured test tasks to pair with implementation (T058b-e, T065a, T109-T114, T118)\n- Meets constitution Principle IV >80% test coverage requirement\n\n## Specification Improvements (spec.md)\n- FR-007: Added detailed Spark Score normalization methodology\n- FR-013: Specified exponential backoff retry logic (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)\n- FR-015: Added concrete error message examples\n- FR-017: Defined Lightning Round Stats format (max 80 chars, pattern)\n- FR-028: New requirement for deleted/private repository handling\n- SC-001: Clarified target audience (developers familiar with GitHub Actions)\n- SC-005: Added programmatic WCAG validation requirement (4.5:1 contrast)\n- Edge cases: Removed duplication, now reference functional requirements\n\n## Plan Improvements (plan.md)\n- Updated summary to use consistent \"markhazleton account\" terminology\n- Fixed constitution check status from \"not defined\" to \"exists and verified\"\n- Corrected config schema to match spec's 5 output categories\n- Added constitution compliance verification for all 5 principles\n\n## Task Improvements (tasks.md)\n- Added T058a: Deleted/private repository handling (FR-028)\n- Added T058b-e: Unit tests for StatsCalculator and StatisticsVisualizer\n- Added T065a: WCAG contrast validation unit tests\n- Enhanced T109-T114: Improved test specifications with acceptance criteria\n- Added T118: Explicit >80% coverage verification task\n- Updated task counts and parallel opportunities\n- Added constitution compliance note\n\n## Infrastructure\n- Created comprehensive .gitignore for Python project\n- Blocks API cache (.cache/), tokens (secrets/), credentials\n- Keeps example SVGs in assets/examples/ for documentation\n- Security-focused: prevents accidental token/credential commits\n- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)\n\n## Coverage Metrics\n- Requirements with tasks: 28/28 (100%)\n- Success criteria with validation: 9/11 (81.8%)\n- Constitution alignment: 5/5 principles (100%)\n- Total tasks: 127 (includes test coverage)\n\nReady for /speckit.implement\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>",
