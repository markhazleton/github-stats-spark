    "ai_summary": "Based on the comprehensive README and repository details, here's a technical summary of TaskListProcessor:\n\nTaskListProcessor is a sophisticated .NET 10.0 library designed to solve complex asynchronous task orchestration challenges in enterprise-level applications, providing a robust framework for coordinating and managing concurrent, distributed operations with advanced resilience and observability features. The library implements enterprise-grade patterns including dependency injection, circuit breakers, and advanced task scheduling, enabling developers to build high-performance, fault-tolerant systems that can efficiently process multiple asynchronous tasks with built-in telemetry, error handling, and performance monitoring. Architected using SOLID principles, the library offers native .NET dependency injection support, OpenTelemetry integration, and a flexible, type-safe approach to task processing that supports priority-based execution, dependency resolution, and comprehensive error categorization. Key differentiators include its strong focus on performance optimization, enterprise-level observability, and a developer-friendly API that abstracts complex concurrent processing patterns while providing granular control over task execution, making it particularly valuable for microservice architectures, distributed systems, and high-concurrency applications requiring sophisticated task management. The project demonstrates a modern, thoughtful approach to solving complex distributed computing challenges, with extensive documentation, learning paths, and a clear commitment to addressing real-world enterprise software development needs.\n\nKey Technical Highlights:\n- Language/Framework: C#/.NET 10.0\n- Core Patterns: Circuit Breaker, Dependency Injection\n- Advanced Features: Parallel Processing, OpenTelemetry, Dynamic Scheduling\n- Target Use Cases: Enterprise Applications, Distributed Systems, Microservices",
