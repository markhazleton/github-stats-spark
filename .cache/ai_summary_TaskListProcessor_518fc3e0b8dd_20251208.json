    "ai_summary": "Based on the comprehensive README and repository details, here's a technical summary:\n\nTaskListProcessor is an advanced .NET 10.0 library designed to solve complex asynchronous task orchestration challenges in enterprise-grade applications, providing a robust framework for managing concurrent, distributed, and resilient task processing. The library implements sophisticated enterprise patterns including circuit breakers, dependency injection, and advanced scheduling, with first-class support for OpenTelemetry integration, type-safe results, and configurable concurrency management. Its architecture emphasizes SOLID principles, offering developers a powerful toolkit for building high-performance, fault-tolerant systems that can efficiently coordinate multiple asynchronous operations across microservices, API interactions, and distributed computing environments. Key differentiators include its native .NET dependency injection support, rich telemetry capabilities, strongly-typed result handling, and intelligent task dependency resolution with topological sorting and execution ordering. The project targets enterprise developers and system architects working on complex distributed systems requiring sophisticated async coordination, providing a comprehensive solution that goes beyond basic task management by incorporating advanced resilience, observability, and performance optimization strategies. TaskListProcessor represents a mature approach to async programming, bridging the gap between theoretical concurrency patterns and practical, production-ready implementation in modern .NET applications.",
