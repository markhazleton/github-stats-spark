    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nWebSpark.HttpClientUtility is a sophisticated .NET library designed to dramatically simplify and enhance HTTP client interactions by providing a comprehensive, one-line configuration for enterprise-grade HTTP communication. The library leverages modern .NET technologies (targeting .NET 8-10) and integrates multiple resilience patterns and observability features, including Polly-based retry and circuit breaker mechanisms, intelligent response caching, structured logging, correlation ID tracking, and OpenTelemetry tracing. Its architecture focuses on reducing boilerplate code while providing robust, production-ready HTTP communication capabilities, with a particular emphasis on microservices, background workers, and web scraping scenarios. \n\nThe project stands out through its opinionated yet flexible design, offering developers a drop-in solution that automatically handles complex concerns like error management, request/response logging, performance monitoring, and caching without requiring extensive manual configuration. By abstracting away common HTTP client complexities and providing intelligent defaults, WebSpark.HttpClientUtility enables developers to focus on business logic while ensuring enterprise-grade reliability, with comprehensive test coverage (237+ unit tests), semantic versioning, and support for modern .NET features like Native AOT and IL trimming.\n\nKey Technical Highlights:\n- Comprehensive HTTP client utility with minimal setup\n- Built-in resilience patterns via Polly integration\n- Automatic correlation ID and structured logging\n- OpenTelemetry tracing support\n- Intelligent, configurable response caching\n- Native AOT and trimming compatibility\n- Supports .NET 8 LTS, .NET 9, and .NET 10 Preview\n- Comprehensive test suite (237+ unit tests)\n- MIT licensed, production-ready\n\nTarget Users:\n- Microservices developers\n- API integration specialists\n- Web scraping engineers\n- Background service developers",
