The `Program.cs` file is updated to include necessary services for Swagger, Bootswatch, and HTTP client utilities. New API endpoints for managing employees and departments are added, along with a status endpoint.\n\nThe `SampleCRUDService.cs` file is refactored to utilize an `HttpClient` for making API calls, improving the structure and maintainability of the code. The project file (`RESTRunner.Web.csproj`) is updated to include new package references for Swagger and Bootswatch.\n\nAdditionally, front-end files (`Index.cshtml`, `_Layout.cshtml`, etc.) are modified to implement a responsive UI with Bootstrap 5 and provide a theme switcher feature. Configuration settings in `appsettings.json` are also added for HTTP request options.\n\nAlso, new comments and licensing information are added to the top of `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` and `jquery.min.js` files to enhance documentation and clarify usage rights."
