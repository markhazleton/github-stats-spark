    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nThis is an ASP.NET Core 6 MVC web application designed as an administrative management system for a fictional company called Carved Rock, focusing on product and category management with robust authentication and data management capabilities. The application leverages Entity Framework Core with SQLite for data persistence, implements ASP.NET Identity for user authentication, and demonstrates modern web development practices including dependency injection, repository patterns, and comprehensive validation using both data annotations and FluentValidation. Key technical features include full CRUD operations for products and categories, role-based access control, self-registration functionality, and a clean, Bootstrap-styled user interface that showcases best practices in .NET web development. The project serves as an educational reference and starter template for developers learning ASP.NET Core MVC, demonstrating integration of multiple enterprise-level frameworks and techniques in a compact, demonstrable application. While primarily an educational resource, it provides a solid foundation for building administrative web applications with strong separation of concerns, testability, and modern .NET ecosystem tooling.",
