    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nThe Supermarket-API is a RESTful web service built with ASP.NET Core and .NET 8, designed to demonstrate best practices for creating maintainable and decoupled API architectures in enterprise software development. The API provides endpoints for managing supermarket-related resources like products and categories, leveraging Entity Framework Core for data access, AutoMapper for object mapping, and Swagger for API documentation and interactive testing. It implements modern .NET development patterns including record types, nullable reference types, and dependency injection, with a clean, modular architecture that separates concerns between controllers, services, and data models. The project serves as an educational reference for developers looking to understand advanced API design techniques, featuring comprehensive versioning, pagination, in-memory database support for testing, and Docker containerization. While primarily an instructional example, the API demonstrates production-ready patterns for building scalable, maintainable .NET web services with a focus on clean code and architectural flexibility.",
