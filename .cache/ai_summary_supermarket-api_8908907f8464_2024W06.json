    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the supermarket-api repository:\n\nThe supermarket-api is a RESTful API template built with ASP.NET Core and .NET 8, designed to demonstrate best practices in creating maintainable and decoupled web services for a hypothetical supermarket inventory management system. The project implements a clean architecture using Entity Framework Core for data access, AutoMapper for object mapping, and Swagger for API documentation, showcasing advanced .NET development techniques such as repository patterns, dependency injection, and comprehensive endpoint management. Key features include product and category management, pagination support, in-memory database testing, and Docker containerization, making it an excellent reference implementation for developers learning modern .NET API development. The project stands out for its iterative improvements across multiple .NET versions, progressive refactoring, and focus on clean, idiomatic C# code, utilizing modern language features like record types, nullable reference types, and primary constructors. Targeted primarily at .NET developers, software architects, and learners seeking a structured example of building scalable, maintainable RESTful APIs with comprehensive architectural considerations.",
