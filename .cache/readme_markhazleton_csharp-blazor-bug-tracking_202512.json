  "value": "# MVC Crash Course - ASP.NET Core 6\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* Install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)\n* Have an IDE installed - the three main options are:\n  * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - include the [C# language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)\n  * [Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - Community Edition is fine\n  * [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)\n* Trust the dotnet dev https certificate: `dotnet dev-certs https -t`\n\n**N O T E:** when this project runs it will create two different Sqlite\ndatabases, stored in the `Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData` folder.  (`C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local` on Windows and `/Users/USERNAME/.local/share` on Mac):\n\n* `carvedrock-admin.db` (this is the main application database)\n* `carvedrock-admin-users.db` (this is ASP.NET Core Identity)\n\n### VS Code Setup\n\nAny flavor of Visual Studio or Rider will include\nthe things you need to run ASP.NET projects, but\nVS Code requires some additional setup.\n\nThe `C#` extension (link above) is required to use this repo.  I have some other settings that you may be curious about\nand they are described in my [VS Code gist](https://gist.github.com/dahlsailrunner/1765b807940e29951ea6bdfb36cd85dd).\n\n## App features\n\nThe application is the starting point for an \"Admin\" application\nfor a fictional company called Carved Rock for its users to maintain\nthe products that it sells.\n\n* The primary technology is **ASP.NET Core 6 MVC**\n* **Entity Framework (EF) Core** is used with Sqlite for the database\n* Basic CRUD operations are supported on Products and Cateogories\n* Styled with Bootstrap and the [Litera Bootwatch theme](https://bootswatch.com/litera/)\n* Repository and Domain Logic classes are used with **dependency injection (DI)** to support testability\n* The Category of a product is a related entity with navigation property\n* **Validation** is present on both categories and products, and a sample of\n    more complex validation is included on Products with **FluentValidation**\n* Products and Categories require users to be **authenticated**\n* **ASP.NET Identity** (scaffolded) is used for the the authentication (self-registration works fine - no inital users are created)\n* The \"initial data\" is reset each time the app starts, so\n  feel free to play around!!\n\n## Doc References\n\n* [.NET CLI (`dotnet` command)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools)\n* [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-6.0)\n* **User Interface**\n  * [Tag Helpers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/built-in/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)\n  * [Razor Syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor?view=aspnetcore-6.0)\n  * [Validation and Data Annotations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation)\n* **Data / Entity Framework (EF) Core**\n  * [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core)\n  * [Database Providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli)\n  * [Migrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations)\n  * [Relationships](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/relationships)\n* **Fluent Validation**\n  * [General Docs](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/)\n* **Identity**\n  * [General Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)\n  * [Scaffolding Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/scaffold-identity)\n* **Minimal Api**\n  * [Minimal Api Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0)\n  * \n"
