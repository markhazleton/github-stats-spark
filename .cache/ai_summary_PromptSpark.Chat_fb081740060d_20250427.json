    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nPromptSpark.Chat is an interactive, real-time workflow management application built using ASP.NET Core and SignalR that enables users to navigate multi-step conversational processes through an adaptive, dynamic chat interface. The application leverages Adaptive Cards and a flexible workflow engine to guide users through configurable, branching conversation paths, with built-in state management using thread-safe concurrent data structures and optional AI integration for handling complex or unanticipated user interactions. The system's architecture emphasizes server-side conversation persistence, real-time communication, and extensible workflow design, allowing developers to create complex interactive scenarios with minimal overhead by defining workflow nodes as JSON configurations. Key technologies include .NET 7+, SignalR for WebSocket communication, and a modular service-based approach that supports potential AI-driven response generation, making it particularly useful for creating guided user experiences like interactive tutorials, customer support flows, or structured information gathering processes. What distinguishes PromptSpark.Chat is its combination of real-time interactivity, flexible workflow definition, and the ability to seamlessly integrate structured user guidance with potential intelligent response mechanisms, targeting developers and organizations seeking to build sophisticated, interactive conversational experiences.",
