    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary for the PromptSpark.Chat repository:\n\nPromptSpark.Chat is a sophisticated, workflow-driven conversational application built with ASP.NET Core that enables dynamic, interactive chat experiences through adaptive, multi-step processes. The application leverages SignalR for real-time communication and supports complex, state-managed conversations where users can navigate through configurable workflow nodes with interactive UI elements like adaptive cards, maintaining conversation context server-side using thread-safe data structures. Its architecture is designed for flexibility, allowing developers to create custom workflows with branching logic, optional AI-driven responses, and seamless user progression through configurable conversation paths. The system's key innovations include server-side conversation persistence, real-time interactive UI rendering, and a modular approach to defining conversational workflows that can be easily extended or modified without significant code changes. Primarily targeting developers, conversational UI designers, and organizations seeking to create structured, guided interaction experiences, PromptSpark.Chat provides a robust framework for building interactive chat applications with minimal overhead and maximum configurability. By integrating technologies like Adaptive Cards and supporting optional AI integration, the project offers a powerful, extensible platform for creating context-aware, interactive communication workflows.",
