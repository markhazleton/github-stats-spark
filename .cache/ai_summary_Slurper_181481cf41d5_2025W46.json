    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the Slurper repository:\n\nSlurper is a dynamic data extraction library for .NET that provides a flexible, configuration-free mechanism for parsing and transforming structured data formats (XML, JSON, CSV, HTML) into easily navigable C# objects without requiring explicit type definitions. The library leverages dynamic object capabilities and a flexible extraction API to enable developers to rapidly work with complex data sources using intuitive property access, eliminating the traditional overhead of manual model creation and parsing. Built with a modern, extensible architecture, Slurper supports multiple data formats through a unified interface, offers comprehensive async and dependency injection support, and implements a plugin system for custom extractors, making it particularly useful for scenarios involving complex data transformation, integration, and rapid prototyping. Technically, the library uses an implementation similar to ExpandoObject to create dynamically typed objects, supports streaming and parallel processing, and provides robust error handling and logging mechanisms. Its key differentiators include zero-configuration data extraction, a consistent cross-format API, and native support for serialization and deserialization across multiple data types. Slurper is particularly valuable for developers working with heterogeneous data sources, microservices integration, data migration, and scenarios requiring flexible, runtime-defined data parsing.",
