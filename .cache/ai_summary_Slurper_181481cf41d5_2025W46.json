    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nSlurper is a .NET library designed to simplify data extraction and transformation across multiple structured data formats (XML, JSON, CSV, and HTML) by providing a dynamic, configuration-free approach to parsing and accessing complex data structures. The library leverages dynamic object capabilities in C# to allow developers to extract and navigate data without explicitly defining model classes, using an intelligent extraction mechanism that automatically converts input data into easily accessible dynamic objects with flexible property access. Built with modern .NET principles, Slurper supports async operations, dependency injection, and provides a consistent API across different data formats, making it particularly valuable for scenarios involving data integration, parsing heterogeneous data sources, or working with loosely structured data. The library's key innovation lies in its ability to treat various data formats uniformly, enabling developers to work with extracted data through simple, intuitive property access without the overhead of traditional strongly-typed mapping approaches. Architecturally, Slurper employs a factory pattern for extractor creation, supports extensibility through a plugin system, and is designed with performance considerations like streaming and parallel processing options. It targets .NET developers working in data processing, integration, web scraping, API consumption, and other domains requiring flexible, dynamic data manipulation across different formats.",
