    "ai_summary": "WebSpark.SharedKernel is a comprehensive .NET library designed to implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns and clean architecture principles, providing developers with a robust set of base classes and utilities for building scalable, maintainable enterprise applications. The library offers type-safe entity base classes, value object implementations, domain event infrastructure, repository pattern abstractions, and CQRS support, all built with strong typing, immutability, and domain-driven design principles in mind. It leverages modern C# features and integrates seamlessly with MediatR for event dispatching and command/query handling, while providing generic implementations for entities, repositories, and domain events that support multiple ID types and follow best practices for domain modeling. The shared kernel approach allows developers to establish a consistent foundation across microservices or complex application architectures, with built-in support for guard clauses, specification patterns, and comprehensive logging behaviors. Notably, the library is particularly well-suited for enterprise .NET developers building complex business applications who want to enforce clean architecture principles and reduce boilerplate code around domain modeling and infrastructure concerns.",
