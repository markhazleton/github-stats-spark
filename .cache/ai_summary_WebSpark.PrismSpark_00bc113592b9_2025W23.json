    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nWebSpark.PrismSpark is a high-performance C#/.NET syntax highlighting library inspired by PrismJS, designed to provide advanced code tokenization and rendering capabilities for web and application environments. The library offers comprehensive support for over 20 programming languages, featuring a robust plugin system, flexible theming infrastructure, and extensible highlighting mechanisms with performance-optimized async processing and caching strategies. Architecturally, the project leverages dependency injection, interface-based design, and a modular approach, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate syntax highlighting into .NET web applications, particularly ASP.NET MVC and Razor-based projects. Key differentiators include its sophisticated theming system with CSS generation, extensive customization options through hooks and plugins, and a clean, intuitive API that supports line numbering, context-aware highlighting, and metadata enrichment. The library is particularly valuable for developers building documentation sites, code editors, learning platforms, or any application requiring sophisticated, configurable code presentation with minimal performance overhead. By providing a strongly-typed, .NET-native implementation of syntax highlighting, WebSpark.PrismSpark offers a more integrated and type-safe alternative to traditional JavaScript-based highlighting solutions.",
