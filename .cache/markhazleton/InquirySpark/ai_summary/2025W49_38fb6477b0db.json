    "ai_summary": "InquirySpark is a .NET 10-based survey and inquiry management system designed for read-only data exploration, utilizing an MVC architecture with SQLite as the primary persistence mechanism. The solution provides a comprehensive admin interface built with Bootstrap 5 and DataTables, enabling structured data navigation and analysis across multiple project layers (Admin, Repository, Common) with strict architectural boundaries and immutable database design. Leveraging modern .NET technologies like Entity Framework Core 10 and focusing on nullable reference types and XML documentation, the project emphasizes clean code practices, dependency injection, and a CDN-free implementation strategy. Its unique approach lies in enforcing read-only database interactions, preventing schema mutations, and providing a lightweight, self-contained survey management ecosystem that can be easily deployed without complex database infrastructure. The system appears targeted at organizations or researchers seeking a streamlined, standards-compliant tool for managing and exploring survey data with minimal configuration overhead and strong architectural constraints.",
