    "ai_summary": "InquirySpark is a .NET 10-based survey and inquiry management system designed for read-only data interaction, utilizing an MVC architecture with a focus on immutable SQLite databases and strict data access patterns. The solution provides a comprehensive admin interface built with Bootstrap 5 and DataTables, enabling users to interact with survey data through a robust, warning-free implementation that emphasizes type safety, dependency injection, and centralized configuration. Key technologies include Entity Framework Core 10, Microsoft.Data.Sqlite provider, ASP.NET Core Identity, and a modular project structure spanning admin, repository, and common libraries with integrated unit testing via MSTest. The project's unique approach lies in its enforcement of read-only database interactions, elimination of SQL Server dependencies, and a carefully designed persistence layer that prevents schema or data mutations while providing a flexible, scalable framework for survey management. Target users include administrators and organizations seeking a lightweight, secure, and easily deployable survey management solution with minimal infrastructure requirements and strong architectural constraints.",
