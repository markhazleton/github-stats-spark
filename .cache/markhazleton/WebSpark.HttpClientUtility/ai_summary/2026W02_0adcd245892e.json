    "ai_summary": "Technical Repository Summary:\n\nWebSpark.HttpClientUtility is a comprehensive .NET HTTP client utility library designed to simplify and enhance HTTP communication in modern .NET applications (versions 8-10), providing a drop-in solution for enterprise-grade HTTP request handling. The library offers a sophisticated, one-line configuration approach that integrates multiple advanced features including Polly-based resilience patterns (retry/circuit breaker), intelligent response caching, structured logging with correlation IDs, and OpenTelemetry tracing, effectively reducing boilerplate code and standardizing HTTP interaction patterns. Built with a focus on production readiness, the library supports native AOT compilation, includes extensive test coverage (237+ unit tests), and provides separate packages for core HTTP utilities and web crawling functionalities, making it particularly suitable for microservices, background workers, and distributed system architectures. By leveraging modern .NET dependency injection, OpenTelemetry, and resilience frameworks, WebSpark.HttpClientUtility abstracts complex HTTP client configuration into a minimal, developer-friendly interface that automatically handles error management, request/response logging, and observability concerns without requiring extensive manual setup.\n\nKey Technical Highlights:\n- Language: C#\n- Target Frameworks: .NET 8-10\n- Key Dependencies: Polly, Microsoft.Extensions.Http, OpenTelemetry\n- Architecture: Dependency Injection-based, Service-oriented\n- Unique Value: Enterprise-grade HTTP client configuration in a single method call\n\nRecommended for developers building microservices, distributed systems, and APIs requiring robust, observable HTTP communication with minimal configuration overhead.",
