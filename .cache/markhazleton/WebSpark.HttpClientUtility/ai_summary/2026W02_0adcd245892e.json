    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the WebSpark.HttpClientUtility repository:\n\nWebSpark.HttpClientUtility is a sophisticated .NET HTTP client utility library designed to simplify and enhance HTTP communication for modern .NET applications, particularly microservices and distributed systems. The library provides a comprehensive, drop-in solution for HTTP requests that integrates multiple enterprise-grade capabilities like Polly-based resilience patterns, intelligent response caching, structured logging, correlation tracking, and OpenTelemetry instrumentation\u2014all configurable through a single method call (`AddHttpClientUtility()`). Built for .NET 8-10, the library leverages modern .NET features and follows best practices in distributed system design, offering developers a high-performance, production-ready HTTP client wrapper that dramatically reduces boilerplate code and implements complex observability and reliability patterns with minimal configuration. Key differentiators include its focus on zero-configuration setup, comprehensive testing (237+ unit tests), native AOT and trimming support, and a commitment to semantic versioning and long-term framework compatibility. The library is particularly well-suited for developers building microservices, background workers, and web crawlers who require robust, observable HTTP communication with minimal implementation complexity.",
