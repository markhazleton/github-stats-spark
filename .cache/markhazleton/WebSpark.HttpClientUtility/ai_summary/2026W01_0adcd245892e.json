    "ai_summary": "Here's a technical summary of the WebSpark.HttpClientUtility repository:\n\nWebSpark.HttpClientUtility is a comprehensive .NET HTTP client utility library designed to simplify and enhance HTTP communication for modern .NET applications (8-10+), providing a drop-in solution for complex HTTP interaction scenarios. The library offers an opinionated, high-productivity approach to HTTP client configuration by integrating multiple enterprise-grade features into a single, configurable service, including Polly-based resilience patterns (retries, circuit breakers), intelligent response caching, structured logging with correlation IDs, and OpenTelemetry tracing. Architecturally, it leverages dependency injection, middleware patterns, and extensibility to provide a zero-configuration experience that abstracts away the complexity of manual HTTP client setup, with first-class support for microservices, background workers, and web crawling scenarios. The project distinguishes itself through its comprehensive test suite (237+ unit tests), strict semantic versioning, cross-framework compatibility, and a focus on production-readiness, offering developers a robust, performance-oriented alternative to manual HttpClient configuration with built-in best practices and observability features. Ideal for developers seeking a batteries-included HTTP client solution that reduces boilerplate code while providing enterprise-level reliability and observability across .NET 8 LTS, .NET 9, and .NET 10 preview platforms.",
