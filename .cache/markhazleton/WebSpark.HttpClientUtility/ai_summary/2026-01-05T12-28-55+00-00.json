    "ai_summary": "Here's a technical summary of the WebSpark.HttpClientUtility repository:\n\nWebSpark.HttpClientUtility is a sophisticated .NET HTTP client utility library designed to simplify and enhance HTTP communication in modern .NET applications (versions 8-10). The library provides a comprehensive, drop-in solution for HTTP interactions, offering enterprise-grade features like Polly-based resilience (retry and circuit breaker patterns), intelligent response caching, structured logging with correlation IDs, and built-in OpenTelemetry tracing\u2014all configurable with a single method call. Leveraging dependency injection and modern .NET patterns, the library abstracts away complex HttpClient setup, reducing boilerplate code from 50+ lines to a single configuration method while providing robust observability, error handling, and performance optimization features.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Integrated Polly resilience policies\n- Configurable in-memory response caching\n- Automatic correlation and tracing\n- Support for .NET 8 LTS, 9, and 10 (Preview)\n- Native AOT and IL trimming compatibility\n- Extensive test coverage (237+ unit tests)\n- Semantic versioning and long-term support\n\nThe library is particularly well-suited for microservices, distributed systems, background workers, and web scraping scenarios where reliable, observable HTTP communication is critical. Its design philosophy emphasizes simplicity, performance, and production-readiness, making it an attractive alternative to manually configured HttpClient setups or more rigid HTTP client libraries.",
