URLs with relative paths (\"/\", \"/features/\", etc.)\n\n- src/_data/nuget-cache.json\n  - Update cachedAt timestamp (cache file present in repo; now ignored by watcher)\n\n- src/_includes/layouts/base.njk, header.njk, footer.njk, pages (index.md, features.md, getting-started.md, api-reference.md, examples.md, about.md)\n  - Replace hardcoded paths with url filter usages ({{ '/assets/... ' | url }}), update front-matter permalinks to relative\n  - Footer: make author name a clickable link to https://markhazleton.com\n  - Header: use url filter for home link and navigation items; nav items use item.url | url\n\n- src/assets/css/main.css\n  - Add footer link styles and small polish\n\n- src/pages/* (Markdown) and src/_includes/*\n  - Add content pages (about, api-reference, features, getting-started, examples, home) with proper front matter and content; ensure permalinks are relative\n\n- src/_data and data fetcher (nuget.js referenced in spec; cache handling described)\n  - NuGet API integration implemented with cache fallback pattern (documented in spec and tasks)\n\n- specs/*\n  - specs/001-static-docs-site/plan.md: extensive \"Implementation Completed\" summary, Implementation Learnings, env patterns, configuration, testing & troubleshooting, and success metrics\n  - specs/001-static-docs-site/spec.md: mark feature as complete + add \"Implementation Guide: Eleventy Configuration\"\n  - specs/001-static-docs-site/tasks.md: mark IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE and include full Eleventy Configuration Guide, scripts, troubleshooting, and verification steps\n\n- docs/ (generated output)\n  - Add generated site files under /docs and subfolders:\n    - docs/index.html\n    - docs/features/index.html\n    - docs/getting-started/index.html\n    - docs/examples/index.html\n    - docs/api-reference/index.html\n    - docs/about/index.html\n  - These files reference /assets/... (runtime url filter will rewrite during production), include prism.min.js and theme references, and contain the final site content ready for GitHub Pages.\n\nNotes / rationale:\n- pathPrefix in Eleventy affects both URL generation and output layout. The commit adopts an environment-aware pathPrefix and ensures all templates use the `url` filter so assets and links work identically in dev (root) and production (GitHub Pages subdirectory).\n- Data cache files written during build must be excluded from Eleventy watch to avoid infinite rebuild loops - added watchIgnores for nuget-cache.json.\n- Replaced placeholder Prism assets with a real npm-based bundling approach (scripts/copy-prism.js) to supply full syntax highlighting for C# and other languages.\n- Updated package scripts to run copy-prism before production builds and to set ELEVENTY_ENV via cross-env for cross-platform compatibility.\n- Specs and tasks were updated with an Implementation Summary and detailed \"Implementation Learnings\" to aid future maintenance.\n\nTesting / verification:\n- Local dev: run `cd src && npm install && npm run copy:prism && npm run dev` ; verify http://localhost:8080 loads site with CSS and Prism highlighting.\n- Production build: `npm run build` will output `../docs/WebSpark.HttpClientUtility/` containing the production-ready site; serve it locally to verify behavior before pushing to GitHub Pages.\n- GitHub Pages: target /docs folder; pathPrefix ensures subdirectory URLs are correct.\n\nThis commit completes the static documentation site end-to-end: configuration, content, build tooling, syntax highlighting, NuGet integration, tests/validation scripts, and generated /docs output ready for publishing.",
