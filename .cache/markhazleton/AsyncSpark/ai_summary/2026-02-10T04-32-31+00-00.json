    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary for AsyncSpark:\n\nAsyncSpark is a sophisticated reference implementation and learning platform for advanced asynchronous programming patterns in .NET, designed to demonstrate enterprise-grade async/await techniques with rigorous development standards. The project provides a comprehensive showcase of modern .NET async best practices, including ConfigureAwait(false) usage, proper CancellationToken handling, parallel execution strategies, resilience patterns via Polly, and clean architecture principles, all enforced through an innovative \"constitution-driven development\" approach. Leveraging .NET 10, the repository implements a multi-project solution with web API, console, and test projects that illustrate complex async scenarios across weather service integration, concurrency management, and remote API interactions, with a strong emphasis on code quality, automated testing (targeting 80% coverage), and interactive API documentation powered by Scalar. What sets AsyncSpark apart is its holistic approach to async programming education, combining technical implementation, architectural best practices, automated compliance checking, and comprehensive documentation into a single, meticulously crafted reference implementation that serves both as a learning resource and a production-ready template for developers seeking to master asynchronous programming in modern .NET environments.\n\nKey Technical Highlights:\n- Framework: .NET 10\n- Architecture: Clean Architecture, Dependency Injection\n- Async Patterns: ConfigureAwait(false), CancellationToken, Task.WhenAll\n- Resilience: Polly integration (retry, timeout, circuit breaker)\n- Testing: MSTest, 80% code coverage requirement\n- Documentation: Scalar-powered interactive API explorer\n- Unique Approach: Constitution-driven development with automated audits",
