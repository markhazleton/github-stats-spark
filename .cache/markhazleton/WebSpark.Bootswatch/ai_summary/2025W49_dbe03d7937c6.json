    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary for the WebSpark.Bootswatch repository:\n\nWebSpark.Bootswatch is a sophisticated .NET Razor Class Library designed to seamlessly integrate Bootswatch themes into ASP.NET Core applications, providing a robust theming solution built on Bootstrap 5 with advanced dynamic theme management capabilities. The library offers comprehensive multi-framework support (targeting .NET 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0) and implements sophisticated features like automatic theme detection, light/dark mode switching, high-performance stylesheet caching, and responsive design through a tag helper-driven architecture. Leveraging modern .NET technologies and following best practices in dependency injection and service configuration, the library provides developers with a turnkey solution for implementing complex theming systems with minimal configuration overhead, featuring intelligent error handling, fallback mechanisms, and extensible design patterns. Its unique value proposition lies in its ability to abstract away the complexity of theme management, offering a streamlined approach to integrating Bootswatch themes with built-in performance optimizations like stylesheet caching, retry mechanisms, and circuit breaker patterns. The library is particularly well-suited for enterprise and commercial .NET applications requiring dynamic, responsive UI theming with minimal performance impact and maximum developer convenience.",
