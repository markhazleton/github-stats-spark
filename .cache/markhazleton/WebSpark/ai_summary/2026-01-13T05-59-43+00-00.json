    "ai_summary": "Based on the detailed README and repository information, here's a comprehensive technical summary of WebSpark:\n\nWebSpark is a sophisticated .NET 9 web application suite designed to provide modular, enterprise-grade web solutions across multiple domains, including prompt optimization for large language models, recipe management, and quiz creation. The project distinguishes itself through a rigorous spec-driven development workflow, featuring an innovative SpecKit command-line toolchain that enforces systematic feature specification, implementation planning, risk assessment, and validation before code development. \n\nThe architecture is highly modular, spanning eight distinct areas (PromptSpark, RecipeSpark, TriviaSpark, WebCMS, GitHubSpark, AsyncSpark, Admin, and Identity), built using modern web technologies including ASP.NET Core MVC, Bootstrap 5, and featuring an advanced SEO optimization framework with comprehensive metadata management, structured data generation, and multi-engine webmaster tool integration. A standout feature is the `/speckit.critic` command, which performs adversarial risk assessment, automatically detecting potential technical vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and architectural anti-patterns before implementation.\n\nThe project demonstrates a strong emphasis on developer productivity, quality assurance, and scalable web application design, with particular attention to SEO performance, metadata management, and a disciplined approach to feature development. The spec-driven workflow, complete with branch protection rules and detailed specification requirements, represents a sophisticated approach to managing complex web application development.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- .NET 9 backend with ASP.NET Core MVC\n- Bootstrap 5 frontend\n- Comprehensive SEO optimization\n- Advanced spec-driven development workflow\n- Modular, multi-domain web application architecture\n- Automated risk assessment and implementation validation\n- Structured data and metadata management\n- Performance monitoring with Web Vitals integration\n\nThe repository is ideal for developers seeking a robust, well-architected framework for building scalable, SEO-optimized web applications with a focus on systematic development practices.",
