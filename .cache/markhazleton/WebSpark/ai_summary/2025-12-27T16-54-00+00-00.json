    "ai_summary": "Based on the detailed README and repository overview, here's a comprehensive technical summary of WebSpark:\n\nWebSpark is a sophisticated, modular web application suite built with .NET 9 and Bootstrap 5, designed to provide specialized tools for prompt management, recipe tracking, and quiz creation. The project distinguishes itself through a rigorous spec-driven development workflow powered by a custom SpecKit command-line toolchain that enforces comprehensive specification, planning, risk assessment, and implementation validation processes. The architecture spans eight distinct modular areas (PromptSpark, RecipeSpark, TriviaSpark, WebCMS, GitHubSpark, AsyncSpark, Admin, and Identity), demonstrating a highly scalable and extensible approach to web application development.\n\nKey technical highlights include advanced SEO optimization capabilities with comprehensive metadata management, structured data generation, multi-engine webmaster tool integration, and performance monitoring through Web Vitals tracking. The project leverages modern web technologies including ASP.NET Core MVC, implements sophisticated branch protection rules, and includes an innovative adversarial risk assessment mechanism (/speckit.critic) that proactively identifies potential implementation risks across security, performance, and architectural dimensions.\n\nThe development workflow is particularly noteworthy, introducing a structured approach that mandates detailed specifications, implementation plans, task breakdowns, and mandatory risk assessments before any code can be merged. This approach ensures high-quality, well-documented, and thoroughly vetted feature implementations, making WebSpark not just a set of web applications, but a comprehensive framework for disciplined software development.\n\nTarget users include developers, content creators, and organizations seeking a robust, modular web application framework with built-in best practices for specification, implementation, and quality assurance. The project's emphasis on SEO, performance optimization, and structured development makes it particularly appealing for teams prioritizing systematic and thorough software engineering practices.",
