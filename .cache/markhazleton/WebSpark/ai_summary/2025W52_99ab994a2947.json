    "ai_summary": "Based on the comprehensive README and repository details, here's a technical summary of WebSpark:\n\nWebSpark is a sophisticated .NET 9-based web application suite designed to provide modular, scalable solutions for prompt management, recipe tracking, and quiz creation, leveraging modern web technologies like ASP.NET Core MVC and Bootstrap 5. The project distinguishes itself through a rigorous spec-driven development workflow called SpecKit, which implements an innovative, structured approach to feature development that includes comprehensive specification, implementation planning, risk assessment, and validation stages. The application encompasses eight distinct modular areas (PromptSpark, RecipeSpark, TriviaSpark, WebCMS, GitHubSpark, AsyncSpark, Admin, and Identity), with a particular emphasis on advanced SEO optimization featuring dynamic metadata generation, structured data markup, and comprehensive analytics integration.\n\nKey Technical Highlights:\n- Framework: .NET 9\n- Frontend: Bootstrap 5\n- Architecture: Modular, multi-area web application\n- Development Methodology: Spec-driven with automated risk assessment\n- SEO Features: Advanced metadata, structured data, multi-engine verification\n- Performance Monitoring: Web Vitals tracking, Application Insights integration\n\nThe project's most innovative aspect is its SpecKit workflow, which introduces an unprecedented level of pre-implementation risk assessment and structured feature development, including automated checks for potential showstoppers, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues before code implementation begins.",
