    "ai_summary": "Based on the comprehensive README and repository analysis, here's a detailed technical summary of WebSpark:\n\nWebSpark is an ambitious, modular web application suite built with .NET 9 and Bootstrap 5, designed to provide integrated solutions for prompt management, recipe tracking, and quiz creation. The project stands out through its innovative spec-driven development workflow, leveraging a custom SpecKit command-line toolchain that enforces rigorous specification, planning, risk assessment, and implementation processes. The architecture spans eight distinct modular areas (PromptSpark, RecipeSpark, TriviaSpark, WebCMS, GitHubSpark, AsyncSpark, Admin, and Identity), demonstrating a sophisticated, scalable approach to web application development.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Advanced SEO optimization with comprehensive metadata management\n- Structured data implementation using JSON-LD schemas\n- Multi-engine webmaster tools integration\n- Automated performance monitoring via Web Vitals\n- Extensive test coverage (47 passing SEO-related tests)\n\nThe project's most innovative feature is its SpecKit workflow, which introduces an automated, multi-stage development process that includes specification creation, implementation planning, task breakdown, and a novel \"adversarial risk assessment\" that proactively identifies potential technical, security, and performance issues before implementation begins. This approach ensures high-quality, well-documented, and lower-risk software development.\n\nTechnologies used include:\n- Backend: .NET 9, ASP.NET Core MVC\n- Frontend: Bootstrap 5\n- SEO & Analytics: Schema.org, Google Analytics 4\n- Monitoring: Application Insights\n- Development Workflow: Custom SpecKit CLI toolchain\n\nThe repository represents a sophisticated, forward-thinking approach to web application development, emphasizing modularity, performance, SEO optimization, and rigorous technical validation through its unique spec-driven workflow.",
