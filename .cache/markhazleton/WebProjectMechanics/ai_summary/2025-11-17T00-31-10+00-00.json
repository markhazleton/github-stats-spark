    "ai_summary": "Web Project Mechanics is a custom web content management system (CMS) designed to manage multiple websites using a single MS-Access database, developed primarily in Visual Basic .NET and ASP.NET. The system provides a flexible, standalone platform for website management without external dependencies, leveraging caching mechanisms to improve performance and supporting migrations across different web technologies (from ASP to JSP to .NET Framework 4.8). Architecturally, it appears to use a centralized database approach with multi-site support, allowing administrators to manage content across different websites from a unified backend interface. The project's unique characteristics include its long-term development history (spanning over 20 years), minimal external dependencies, and a lightweight approach to web content management that prioritizes simplicity and portability. Targeted primarily at small to medium-sized website owners, developers, and organizations seeking a straightforward, self-contained CMS solution, Web Project Mechanics represents a personal project that has evolved to serve practical web management needs while serving as a technology learning platform for its creator.",
