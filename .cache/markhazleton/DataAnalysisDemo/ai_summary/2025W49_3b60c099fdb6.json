    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the DataAnalysisDemo repository:\n\nThe DataAnalysisDemo is a sophisticated web-based data analytics platform built using ASP.NET WebForms (VB.NET) that transforms raw CSV data into interactive, visually rich analytical experiences, enabling users to process, visualize, and explore complex datasets through advanced charting, pivot tables, and dynamic data grids. The application leverages a modern client-side architecture with Webpack, integrating cutting-edge web technologies like Bootstrap 5, jQuery, DataTables, and specialized JavaScript libraries (D3.js, C3.js, PivotTable.js) to provide comprehensive data analysis capabilities with responsive, performant user interfaces. Its core strengths include automatic CSV file processing, real-time statistical analysis, multiple visualization modes (including 2D/3D charting), drag-and-drop pivot table interfaces, and extensive data exploration features that support various aggregation functions, export formats, and interactive data manipulation. Architecturally, the project demonstrates a sophisticated approach to web application design, combining server-side .NET processing with client-side dynamic rendering, featuring a modular structure that separates concerns between data processing, visualization, and user interaction, and implementing a flexible theme management system. What makes this project particularly noteworthy is its comprehensive approach to data analysis, offering researchers, data analysts, and business intelligence professionals a powerful, user-friendly tool for transforming raw data into meaningful insights through multiple lenses of interpretation. The target users range from academic researchers and data scientists to business analysts seeking an adaptable, browser-based platform for exploratory data analysis with minimal setup complexity.",
