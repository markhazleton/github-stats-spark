    "ai_summary": "This repository is a personal technical portfolio and blog site for Mark Hazleton, a Technical Solutions Architect, built as a modern, statically-generated React application with server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities. The site leverages a sophisticated build process using Vite 7, TypeScript, and React 19, with a focus on performance, SEO, and content flexibility, featuring dynamic rendering of blog posts, project portfolios, and GitHub repository metrics through a modular architecture that separates content (Markdown and JSON), components, and rendering logic. The project implements advanced web development practices including static site generation, automatic SEO asset generation, and automated Azure Static Web Apps deployment via GitHub Actions, with a tech stack that includes Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and React Markdown for rich, responsive content presentation. Key architectural innovations include a prerendering pipeline that generates static HTML for all routes, a flexible content management approach allowing easy updates through Markdown and JSON files, and a data fetching strategy that supports both build-time and client-side data retrieval. The site serves as both a professional showcase and a technical demonstration of modern web development techniques, targeting technology professionals, potential employers, and those interested in cloud architecture and engineering practices.",
