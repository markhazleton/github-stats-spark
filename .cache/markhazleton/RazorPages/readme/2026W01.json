  "value": "# Wired Brain Coffee - Full Stack Demo\n\nWelcome to the **Wired Brain Coffee** solution! This repository demonstrates a modern, full-stack .NET application using Razor Pages, Blazor WebAssembly, ASP.NET Core APIs, and Minimal APIs. It is designed as a reference for best practices in architecture, code organization, and developer experience.\n\n---\n\n## Credits & Inspiration\n\n- **Original Author:** [alex-wolf-ps](https://github.com/alex-wolf-ps)\n- **Source of this fork:** [alex-wolf-ps/RazorPages](https://github.com/alex-wolf-ps/RazorPages)\n- **Inspiration:** This project is a fork and creative extension by Mark Hazleton, building on the excellent foundation and ideas from the original repository.\n\n---\n\n## Solution Overview\n\nThis repository contains several projects, each with a distinct role:\n\n### 1. `WiredBrainCoffee` (Razor Pages Web App)\n\n- **Type:** ASP.NET Core Razor Pages\n- **Purpose:** Traditional server-rendered web application for Wired Brain Coffee.\n- **Features:**\n  - Home, Menu, Contact, and Feedback pages\n  - Responsive Bootstrap UI\n  - Menu browsing and details\n  - Contact and feedback forms\n  - Community and promotional sections\n  - Follows best practices for Razor Pages structure\n\n### 2. `WiredBrainCoffee.UI` (Blazor WebAssembly SPA)\n\n- **Type:** Blazor WebAssembly (SPA)\n- **Purpose:** Modern, client-side single-page application for Wired Brain Coffee.\n- **Features:**\n  - Interactive UI with Blazorise and Bootstrap\n  - Coffee and food ordering with tabbed navigation\n  - Dynamic menu loading from API\n  - Real-time chat (SignalR)\n  - Customer and partner contact forms with file upload\n  - Admin dashboard (extensible)\n  - Mailing list and contact info components\n  - Modern, mobile-friendly design\n\n### 3. `WiredBrainCoffee.API` (ASP.NET Core Web API)\n\n- **Type:** ASP.NET Core Web API\n- **Purpose:** Backend API for menu, orders, and contact endpoints.\n- **Features:**\n  - RESTful endpoints for menu and orders\n  - Contact submission with file handling\n  - SignalR chat hub for real-time communication\n  - Integrated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation\n  - CORS and HTTP logging for security and diagnostics\n\n### 4. `WiredBrainCoffee.MinApi` (Minimal API + EF Core)\n\n- **Type:** ASP.NET Core Minimal API\n- **Purpose:** Lightweight, high-performance API for order management.\n- **Features:**\n  - Minimal API endpoints for CRUD operations on orders\n  - Health checks and system status endpoint\n  - Entity Framework Core with SQLite for persistence\n  - CORS, response compression, and Swagger UI\n  - Example of modern .NET minimal API patterns\n\n### 5. `WiredBrainCoffee.Models` (Shared Models)\n\n- **Type:** .NET Class Library\n- **Purpose:** Shared data models for menu items, orders, contacts, and more.\n- **Features:**\n  - Strongly-typed models for use across all projects\n  - Includes menu, order, contact, and supporting types\n  - Promotes code reuse and consistency\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. **Clone the repository:**\n\n   ```pwsh\n   git clone https://github.com/MarkHazleton/RazorPages.git\n   ```\n\n2. **Open in Visual Studio 2022+ or VS Code**\n\n3. **Build the solution** to restore dependencies.\n\n4. **Run the projects** as needed:\n   - `WiredBrainCoffee` for the Razor Pages web app\n   - `WiredBrainCoffee.UI` for the Blazor WebAssembly SPA\n   - `WiredBrainCoffee.API` and/or `WiredBrainCoffee.MinApi` for backend APIs\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\n- Clean separation of concerns (UI, API, Models)\n- Modern .NET patterns: Razor Pages, Blazor, Minimal APIs\n- Strongly-typed shared models\n- Responsive, accessible UI with Bootstrap/Blazorise\n- Real-time features with SignalR\n- Secure file upload and CORS configuration\n- Automated API documentation (Swagger)\n- Health checks and diagnostics\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please open issues or submit pull requests to help improve this demo.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n---\n\n**Wired Brain Coffee** \u2013 Brewed for developers. Enjoy exploring this full-stack .NET reference!\n",
