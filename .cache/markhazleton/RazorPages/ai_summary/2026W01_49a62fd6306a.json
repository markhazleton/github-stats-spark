    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nThe RazorPages repository is a comprehensive full-stack .NET demonstration project for a fictional coffee shop application (Wired Brain Coffee) that showcases modern web development practices across multiple project types. The solution features a robust, multi-project architecture implementing Razor Pages, Blazor WebAssembly, ASP.NET Core Web APIs, and Minimal APIs, with each project serving a distinct architectural purpose such as server-side rendering, client-side single-page application, backend API services, and shared data modeling. Key technologies include .NET 6+, Entity Framework Core, SignalR, Bootstrap, Blazorise, and SQLite, with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, separation of concerns, and implementing contemporary .NET development patterns like minimal APIs and WebAssembly. The project serves as an educational reference demonstrating best practices in full-stack web application development, providing developers with a practical, production-like example of building scalable, interactive web applications with modern Microsoft development tools and frameworks. Notably, the solution goes beyond a typical demo by implementing real-world features like responsive design, file uploads, real-time chat, API documentation, and comprehensive project structure, making it a valuable learning resource for developers seeking to understand comprehensive .NET web application development.",
