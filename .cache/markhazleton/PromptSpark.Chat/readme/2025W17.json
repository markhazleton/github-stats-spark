  "value": "# PromptSpark Chat Workflow\n\n**A real-time, conversational workflow application built with ASP.NET Core, SignalR, and Adaptive Cards. It demonstrates how to guide users through multi-step processes, present interactive UI elements, and optionally integrate AI-driven responses\u2014all while providing flexible workflow logic, simple concurrency management, and minimal overhead.**\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [Overview](#overview)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Technologies](#technologies)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n- [References](#references)\n\n## Overview\nPromptSpark Chat Workflow provides a dynamic chat interface where users:\n- Enter a name\n- Choose from a list of workflows\n- Interact with adaptive cards or text responses\n- Progress through branching logic driven by workflow nodes\n\nAll conversation data is stored server-side for continuity, so users can refresh the page without losing their place.\n\n## Features\n- **Adaptive Cards** for interactive input\n- **Real-time Communication** with SignalR\n- **Workflow Persistence** in memory using a thread-safe store\n- **AI Integration** to handle questions not covered by the workflow\n\n## Technologies\n- **ASP.NET Core** for the main web application framework\n- **SignalR** for real-time client-server communication\n- **Adaptive Cards** for rendering structured inputs\n- **Concurrent Dictionary** for storing conversation state\n- **Optional AI** functionality via chat completion services\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFollow these steps to set up, build, and run the **PromptSpark.Chat** application. If you have any issues or questions, please create a GitHub Issue or submit a Pull Request.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **.NET SDK 7.0+** (or the latest LTS version)  \n  You can check your version by running `dotnet --version` in your terminal.\n\n### Clone the Repository\n\n**1.** Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project.  \n```bash\ncd path/to/directory\n```\n\n**2.** Clone the repository:  \n\n```bash\ngit clone\n```\n\n**3.** Change into the cloned directory:  \n\n```bash\ncd PromptSpark.Chat\n```\n\n### Project Structure Overview\n\n```\nPromptSpark.Chat/\n\u251c\u2500 PromptSpark.Chat.csproj\n\u251c\u2500 Controllers/\n\u251c\u2500 Models/\n\u251c\u2500 Services/\n\u251c\u2500 Views/\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 Chat/\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 chat.cshtml\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 Shared/\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 Home/\n\u251c\u2500 wwwroot/\n\u251c\u2500 appsettings.json\n\u251c\u2500 LICENSE\n\u2514\u2500 README.md\n```\n\n- **Controllers/** \u2013 Houses your ASP.NET Core MVC controllers.  \n- **Services/** \u2013 Contains core business logic and workflow/AI integration classes.  \n- **Views/** \u2013 Razor views for the UI (`chat.cshtml`).  \n- **wwwroot/** \u2013 Static content, such as CSS and JavaScript files.  \n- **appsettings.json** \u2013 Configuration details.  \n- **LICENSE** \u2013 MIT License file.  \n- **README.md** \u2013 Documentation.\n\n### Configure Workflows\n\nIf you want to add a custom workflow, create a JSON file (e.g., `myWorkflow.json`), \nthen make it known to the application\u2019s workflow loading logic:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"StartNode\": \"node1\",\n  \"Nodes\": [\n    {\n      \"Id\": \"node1\",\n      \"Question\": \"Hello, what's your favorite color?\",\n      \"QuestionType\": 0,\n      \"Answers\": [\n        {\n          \"Response\": \"Blue\",\n          \"NextNode\": \"node2\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"Response\": \"Red\",\n          \"NextNode\": \"node2\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"Id\": \"node2\",\n      \"Question\": \"Great choice!\",\n      \"QuestionType\": 2,\n      \"Answers\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n> **Note:** The `QuestionType` values or node structure may vary. Refer to your `Node` model for valid properties.\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1. **Using Visual Studio**  \n   - Open the solution in Visual Studio.  \n   - Press `F5` or use the \u201cStart Debugging\u201d option.  \n   - The application will launch in your browser.\n\n2. **Using the .NET CLI**  \n   - Restore and build the project, then run it.  \n   [PLACEHOLDER FOR CLI COMMAND BLOCK]\n\n   - Check the output for the local URL (e.g., `https://localhost:5001`).  \n   - Open your browser and navigate to that URL.\n\n### Verification & Usage\n\n1. **Open the Chat UI:**  \n   Enter your name and select a workflow from the dropdown.\n\n2. **Interact with Adaptive Cards:**  \n   You\u2019ll see interactive elements (buttons, text inputs). Submit these and let the system guide you to the next step.\n\n3. **Refresh Persistence:**  \n   The conversation is stored server-side. Reloading the page should preserve your progress, provided you have the same conversation ID.\n\n### Example Interaction\n\n1. **Name Input** \u2013 Type a name.  \n2. **Workflow Selection** \u2013 Choose a workflow file (like `myWorkflow.json`).  \n3. **Chat Exchange** \u2013 Complete the prompts with button clicks or typed responses.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **Port Conflicts:** Update your `launchSettings.json` to use different ports if needed.  \n- **Missing Dependencies:** Ensure you have the correct .NET SDK installed and run `dotnet restore`.  \n- **AI Integration:** Update `IChatCompletionService` settings in `appsettings.json` for any required keys/endpoints.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Deploy**: Package and host on Azure, AWS, or an on-prem server.  \n- **Scale**: Use Azure SignalR Service if your user load is high.  \n- **Test**: Integrate a testing framework and set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD.  \n- **Extend**: Add more complex workflows and branching logic as your application grows.\n\n## Usage\nOnce deployed, users can:\n1. Enter their name.\n2. Select a workflow.\n3. Follow prompts in the chat window.\n4. Submit answers through text inputs or button options.\n5. Receive immediate responses and progress to subsequent steps.\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome! Please open issues for feature requests or bug reports.
