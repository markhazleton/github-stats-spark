    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nPromptSpark.Chat is an innovative workflow-driven conversational application built with ASP.NET Core that enables dynamic, interactive multi-step communication processes through a real-time web interface. The application leverages SignalR for WebSocket communication and Adaptive Cards to create flexible, interactive user experiences where participants can navigate complex conversational workflows with guided, branching logic and optional AI-assisted responses. Its core architecture utilizes thread-safe server-side state management via Concurrent Dictionary, allowing users to maintain conversation context even during page refreshes, while supporting extensible workflow definitions through JSON configuration. The project demonstrates a sophisticated approach to creating guided interaction scenarios, with built-in support for dynamic input handling, workflow persistence, and potential AI integration, making it particularly useful for scenarios like guided interviews, onboarding processes, or interactive questionnaires. Designed with modularity and scalability in mind, PromptSpark.Chat provides developers with a robust framework for creating conversational interfaces that can adapt to various use cases across customer engagement, training, and interactive communication domains.",
