    "ai_summary": "Here's a detailed technical summary of the FastEndpointApi repository:\n\nFastEndpointApi is a comprehensive demonstration and reference implementation of FastEndpoints, a lightweight REST API framework for ASP.NET Core that implements the REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response) architectural pattern. The project showcases a Person Management API that provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with modern API design principles, including HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) links, clean endpoint separation, and minimal boilerplate code. Built using .NET 9.0 and leveraging FastEndpoints, the project emphasizes clean architecture by separating concerns across endpoints, services, and request/response models, with a focus on creating maintainable and performant API implementations.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Modular endpoint structure with dedicated folders for each operation type\n- In-memory data persistence with a service layer abstraction\n- Automatic request/response mapping using FastEndpoints mapping capabilities\n- Swagger/OpenAPI integration for interactive API documentation\n- Static HTML pages for demonstration and testing\n- Dependency injection for service management\n\nThe project is particularly valuable for .NET developers looking to streamline API development, reduce complexity, and adopt a more modern, lightweight approach to building RESTful services compared to traditional MVC controllers or minimal APIs.\n\nTechnologies:\n- Language: C#\n- Framework: ASP.NET Core\n- Library: FastEndpoints\n- Tools: Swagger/OpenAPI\n- Architectural Pattern: REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response)\n\nThe repository serves as both a practical tutorial and a reference implementation for developers seeking to understand and implement efficient, clean API design principles in .NET.",
