    "ai_summary": "Here's a detailed technical summary of the FastEndpointApi repository:\n\nFastEndpointApi is a comprehensive demonstration project showcasing the FastEndpoints framework for building high-performance, clean, and maintainable ASP.NET Core REST APIs using the REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response) architectural pattern. The project implements a complete Person Management API with full CRUD operations, featuring a lightweight, modular approach to API development that emphasizes minimal boilerplate code and strong separation of concerns. Leveraging .NET 9.0 and the FastEndpoints library, the application provides a robust implementation of RESTful endpoints with advanced features like HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State), automatic mapping, dependency injection, and integrated Swagger documentation.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Modular endpoint structure with dedicated folders for create, read, update, and delete operations\n- In-memory data persistence with a service layer abstraction\n- Comprehensive request/response model mapping\n- Built-in HATEOAS link generation\n- Interactive Swagger UI for API exploration\n- Static HTML sample pages for demonstration\n\nThe project is particularly noteworthy for developers seeking a clean, performant alternative to traditional ASP.NET Core MVC controllers, offering a more streamlined and maintainable approach to API development. It serves as both a practical implementation guide and a reference architecture for building modern .NET web APIs.\n\nTarget users include:\n- .NET developers looking to modernize their API development approach\n- Teams seeking to reduce boilerplate code\n- Developers interested in clean architecture and separation of concerns",
