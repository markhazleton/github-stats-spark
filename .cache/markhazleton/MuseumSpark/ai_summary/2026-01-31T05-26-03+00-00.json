The project leverages a multi-phase data enrichment pipeline that systematically aggregates and validates museum metadata from diverse sources like Wikidata, Wikipedia, and official museum websites, with the ultimate goal of creating a comprehensive, intelligent museum browsing and travel planning experience. Built using a modern Python-based data pipeline and React frontend, the platform employs advanced techniques like JSON Schema validation, web scraping, and planned AI-assisted content generation to create a rich, dynamically updated museum database with sophisticated features such as priority scoring, collection strength assessment, and potential future personalized travel recommendations. The architecture is modular and extensible, with a clear roadmap progressing through distinct data enrichment and feature expansion phases, ultimately aiming to provide art lovers with a strategic tool for discovering and prioritizing museum visits across North America. Unique aspects include its rigorous data quality approach, multi-source data integration, and the vision to transform a simple museum directory into an intelligent, context-aware travel companion powered by structured data and machine learning techniques. The target users are art enthusiasts, travelers, museum researchers, and cultural tourists seeking a data-driven approach to museum exploration and travel planning.",
