    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the SupportSpark repository:\n\nSupportSpark is a compassionate, privacy-focused web application designed to help individuals share personal journey updates with a trusted support network during challenging life moments. Built with a modern, type-safe technology stack including React 19, TypeScript, Express, and Tailwind CSS, the platform provides a calm, distraction-free environment for members to create updates and for supporters to engage through threaded conversations with controlled, invitation-only access. The application emphasizes robust type safety through end-to-end TypeScript and Zod validation, implements accessible UI components using Radix primitives, and follows a strict architectural pattern that separates concerns between client, server, and shared code layers. What sets SupportSpark apart is its intentional design focusing on emotional well-being, offering features like role-based access, real-time updates, and a purposefully minimalist interface that prioritizes meaningful, organized communication during sensitive personal experiences. The project is targeted at individuals navigating health challenges, life transitions, or personal journeys who want a structured, private platform to maintain connections with their support circle without the overwhelming noise of traditional social media.",
