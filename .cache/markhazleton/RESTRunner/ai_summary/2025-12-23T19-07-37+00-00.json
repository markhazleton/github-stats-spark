    "ai_summary": "RESTRunner is a comprehensive .NET 10 solution designed for automated REST API testing, performance benchmarking, and regression testing, with a primary focus on integrating Postman collections for comprehensive API validation. The project offers a robust toolkit that enables developers and QA engineers to perform detailed API tests, including load testing, performance analysis, and generating comprehensive statistical reports through both a console application and a Razor Pages web interface. Built using modern .NET technologies, the solution supports cross-platform execution and emphasizes performance optimization, with features like 19% faster builds, 25% faster test execution, and a focus on package health and security. Key technical capabilities include Postman collection import, automated test suite execution, response time analysis, CSV result export, and a built-in sample CRUD API for demonstration and testing purposes. What makes RESTRunner particularly noteworthy is its commitment to long-term support (.NET 10 LTS), comprehensive testing infrastructure, and a user-friendly approach to API testing that bridges the gap between manual Postman collections and automated, scalable testing frameworks. The project is particularly valuable for software development teams seeking a robust, performance-oriented solution for API quality assurance and performance monitoring.",
