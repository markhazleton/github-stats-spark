    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nSlurper is a versatile .NET data extraction library designed to simplify parsing and transforming structured data formats like XML, JSON, CSV, and HTML into dynamic C# objects with minimal configuration. The library provides a unified, intuitive API that allows developers to extract and navigate complex data structures without manually defining model classes, leveraging dynamic object capabilities and utilizing a flexible factory pattern for data extraction. Built with modern .NET frameworks (targeting .NET 8.0-10.0), Slurper implements an extensible plugin system and supports async operations, dependency injection, and comprehensive error handling, making it particularly valuable for scenarios involving data integration, API consumption, and complex data transformation. Its key innovation lies in the ability to automatically convert various data formats into dynamically accessible objects using a custom implementation similar to ExpandoObject, effectively reducing boilerplate code and providing a more flexible approach to data manipulation compared to traditional strongly-typed parsing methods. The library is particularly suited for developers working with heterogeneous data sources, microservices architectures, or integration scenarios where rapid, schema-less data extraction is required, offering a developer-friendly approach to handling structured data across different formats with minimal overhead.\n\nKey Technical Highlights:\n- Dynamic object generation without pre-defined models\n- Supports XML, JSON, CSV, HTML extraction\n- Async and synchronous extraction methods\n- Dependency injection compatible\n- Semantic versioning and MIT licensing\n- Performance-oriented with streaming and caching options",
