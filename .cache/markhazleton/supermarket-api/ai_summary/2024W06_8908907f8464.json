    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nThe Supermarket API is a comprehensive ASP.NET Core RESTful web service designed to demonstrate best practices in building maintainable and decoupled API architectures, specifically targeting supermarket product and category management. Leveraging .NET 8, Entity Framework Core, and AutoMapper, the API provides a robust implementation with features like pagination, filtering, Swagger documentation, and in-memory database support for efficient development and testing. The project follows a clean, modular architecture with separation of concerns, utilizing record types, dependency injection, and modern C# language features to create a scalable and extensible backend service for managing supermarket inventory and product information. Notable technical highlights include standardized API routing, automatic model validation, caching mechanisms, and flexible querying capabilities that make it an excellent reference implementation for developers learning enterprise-level API design in .NET. The repository serves as both a practical tutorial resource and a template for building production-ready ASP.NET Core web APIs with a focus on code quality, maintainability, and modern software design principles.",
