    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the DecisionSpark repository:\n\nDecisionSpark is an innovative .NET 10 web application that implements a dynamic, conversation-driven decision routing engine designed to guide users through intelligent decision-making processes using minimal questioning and configurable rules. The platform leverages a sophisticated architecture that combines RESTful APIs, Razor Pages, and OpenAI integration to create an adaptive decision-making system capable of generating context-aware recommendations across various domains.\n\nThe core technical architecture centers on a modular, config-driven approach where decision logic is defined through JSON specifications, enabling flexible rule-based routing without requiring code modifications. Key components include a Session Store for managing conversation state, a Routing Evaluator for applying complex decision rules, and a Trait Parser that uses natural language processing to extract meaningful insights from user responses. The system supports multiple question types (text input, single-select, multi-select) and incorporates intelligent routing mechanisms that can derive traits, break ties, and generate contextually appropriate recommendations.\n\nArchitecturally, the application is built on .NET 10 and implements a microservices-inspired design with distinct services for question generation, response mapping, and decision evaluation. OpenAI integration provides advanced natural language capabilities, allowing dynamic question generation and intelligent answer parsing. The platform supports comprehensive logging via Serilog, offers Swagger/OpenAPI documentation, and includes a web interface for interactive testing and exploration of decision scenarios.\n\nUnique features include its ability to create conversational decision workflows through configuration, support for multiple decision domains (demonstrated by examples like Family Saturday Planner and Tech Stack Advisor), and a flexible architecture that allows easy extensibility. The system is designed to be both developer-friendly and adaptable, with clear separation of concerns and a plugin-like approach to adding new decision specifications.\n\nThe project targets developers, product managers, and organizations seeking a sophisticated, configurable decision support system that can be rapidly adapted to different use cases without extensive custom coding. Its combination of natural language processing, rule-based routing, and interactive API design makes it a powerful tool for creating intelligent, conversational decision support experiences.",
