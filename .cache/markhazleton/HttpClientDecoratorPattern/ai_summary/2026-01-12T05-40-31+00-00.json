    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary:\n\nThis repository demonstrates a production-ready implementation of the Decorator Pattern for HttpClient in .NET, providing a sophisticated approach to managing HTTP communication with enhanced resilience, telemetry, and caching capabilities. The project introduces a flexible, composable service architecture that allows dynamically adding cross-cutting concerns like performance monitoring, circuit breaking, and caching without modifying core service implementations. Leveraging .NET 10, dependency injection, and libraries like Polly, the implementation offers a robust solution for enterprise-grade HTTP client management, with strong emphasis on separation of concerns, testability, and observability. The WebSpark.HttpClientUtility package serves as the core implementation, featuring a comprehensive decorator chain that systematically wraps HTTP requests with additional behaviors such as retry policies, correlation tracking, and intelligent caching strategies. By providing a clean, extensible pattern for HTTP communication, the project addresses common challenges in distributed system design, making it particularly valuable for developers building microservices, API-driven applications, or systems requiring sophisticated HTTP interaction management.",
