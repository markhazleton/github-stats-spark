    "ai_summary": "WebSpark.SharedKernel is a comprehensive .NET library designed to simplify Domain-Driven Design (DDD) implementation by providing robust infrastructure for building clean, modular enterprise applications. The library offers a rich set of base classes and utilities for creating type-safe entities, value objects, domain events, and repository abstractions, with strong support for CQRS and MediatR integration. Built primarily in C#, it provides generic implementations for entities with multiple ID type support, implements sophisticated domain event handling, and includes advanced patterns like specification-based repositories and comprehensive logging behaviors. The framework is particularly noteworthy for its flexible, type-safe approach to building complex domain models, offering developers a structured toolkit for implementing clean architecture principles with minimal boilerplate code. It targets .NET developers working on enterprise-level applications who want to implement DDD patterns systematically, with built-in support for guard clauses, domain event dispatching, and extensible repository patterns. The library's design emphasizes type safety, separation of concerns, and providing sensible defaults while maintaining high configurability and adherence to SOLID principles.",
