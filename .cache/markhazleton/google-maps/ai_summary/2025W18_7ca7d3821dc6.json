    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary:\n\nThis repository provides a specialized .NET-based Google Maps Web Services API wrapper that introduces enhanced modularity through a custom HttpClientUtility and minimal API implementation using Fast Endpoints. The project refactors traditional HTTP client interactions by implementing a generic, type-safe approach to managing web service communications, with a focus on decoupling HTTP request handling from specific API mapping logic. Leveraging C# and modern .NET ecosystem tools like Fast Endpoints, the library offers a robust, extensible framework for developers seeking streamlined integration with Google Maps web services, with particular emphasis on clean abstraction, efficient resource management, and flexible HTTP client interactions. The HttpClientUtility component stands out by introducing a generics-based architecture that encapsulates HTTP request/response handling, providing developers with a sophisticated mechanism for managing API communications through strongly-typed response containers and centralized client management. Targeted primarily at .NET developers working on geospatial applications, mapping services, or projects requiring Google Maps API integration, this library represents a sophisticated approach to API client design that prioritizes code maintainability, modularity, and type safety.",
