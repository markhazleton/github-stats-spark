    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nThis repository is a C# wrapper for the Google Maps Web Services API, designed to simplify and enhance interaction with Google Maps services through a modular and extensible architecture. The project introduces a sophisticated HttpClientUtility with generic HTTP request handling, leveraging Fast Endpoints for creating a minimal API layer that abstracts away complex HTTP communication details. By implementing a robust HttpResponseContent<T> generic response container and a generics-based HttpClientService, the library provides a flexible, type-safe approach to making API requests with improved error handling and resource management. The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, with distinct components for HTTP client management, API mapping, and response processing, making it particularly valuable for .NET developers seeking a clean, reusable solution for integrating Google Maps web services. Key technologies include .NET, C#, Fast Endpoints, and a custom HttpClient management approach that enhances performance and maintainability compared to traditional HTTP client implementations. This library is primarily targeted at .NET developers building mapping, geolocation, or location-based services who require a sophisticated, well-structured approach to consuming Google Maps web services.",
