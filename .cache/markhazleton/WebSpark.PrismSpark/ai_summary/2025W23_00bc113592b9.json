    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nWebSpark.PrismSpark is a high-performance C#/.NET syntax highlighting library inspired by PrismJS, designed to provide advanced code tokenization and rendering capabilities for web and application development environments. The library offers comprehensive language support for over 20 programming languages, featuring a robust plugin system, dynamic theming infrastructure, and extensible highlighting mechanisms through hooks, plugins, and custom configuration options. Architecturally, the project follows a modular design with dependency injection support, enabling developers to easily integrate syntax highlighting into .NET web applications, particularly with ASP.NET MVC and Razor views, while providing performance optimizations like async processing and caching. Key differentiators include its flexible theming system that allows dynamic CSS generation, a comprehensive plugin architecture for extending functionality, and native .NET integration that provides more seamless interoperability compared to traditional JavaScript-based highlighting solutions. The library targets developers and technical professionals who require advanced code presentation capabilities, supporting scenarios like documentation sites, code editors, technical blogs, and developer tooling where rich, customizable syntax highlighting is essential. With its MIT license and focus on extensibility, WebSpark.PrismSpark represents a modern, developer-friendly approach to syntax highlighting in the .NET ecosystem.",
