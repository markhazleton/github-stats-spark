    "ai_summary": "WebSpark.PrismSpark is a sophisticated .NET-based syntax highlighting library inspired by PrismJS, designed to provide advanced code rendering and tokenization capabilities for multiple programming languages. The library offers a comprehensive suite of features including support for 20+ programming languages, a plugin system, theme generation, async processing, and extensible highlighting mechanisms with robust .NET 10.0 LTS compatibility. Architecturally, it implements a modular design with interfaces like `IHighlighter`, `IPlugin`, and `ITheme`, enabling developers to easily customize and extend syntax highlighting through dependency injection, hooks, and context-aware processing. The project distinguishes itself through its performance-oriented approach, supporting advanced options like line number rendering, context-based metadata, and dynamic theme generation, making it particularly valuable for web developers, documentation platforms, and code presentation frameworks targeting .NET ecosystems. By providing a type-safe, performant alternative to traditional syntax highlighting libraries, WebSpark.PrismSpark offers developers a powerful tool for rendering and styling code snippets across various .NET web frameworks like MVC, Razor, and potentially Blazor.",
