    "ai_summary": "WebSpark.PrismSpark is a comprehensive .NET-based syntax highlighting library designed to port and enhance the functionality of PrismJS for C# and .NET ecosystems. The library provides advanced code syntax highlighting capabilities across 20+ programming languages, featuring a robust plugin system, extensive theming support, and high-performance tokenization with async processing and caching mechanisms. Built for .NET 10.0 LTS, the library offers deep integration with ASP.NET Web MVC, supporting dependency injection, custom theming, and extensible hook-based customization through interfaces like IPlugin and sophisticated configuration options. Its architecture emphasizes modularity, with support for language-specific grammars, theme generation, and context-aware highlighting that allows developers to easily transform raw code into richly styled, semantically parsed HTML representations. The project stands out by providing a feature-complete, performant alternative to traditional syntax highlighting libraries, with first-class support for modern .NET development patterns and a flexible, event-driven design that enables complex code rendering scenarios. Target users include web developers, documentation generators, code snippet platforms, and educational technology tools seeking a robust, extensible syntax highlighting solution within the .NET ecosystem.",
