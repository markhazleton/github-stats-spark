    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary for the Yelp.Api repository:\n\nYelp.Api is a C# class library that provides a robust, developer-friendly wrapper for Yelp's v3 Fusion API, enabling .NET developers to seamlessly integrate comprehensive local business search and review capabilities into their applications. The library abstracts the complexity of REST API interactions, offering a strongly-typed, async-friendly client that supports flexible search parameters including geolocation, business type, maximum results, and real-time availability filtering. Built for .NET 6, the library implements a clean, intuitive interface for querying Yelp's extensive business database across 32 countries, with simple initialization using an API key and streamlined methods for retrieving business information. The implementation follows a straightforward client-based architectural pattern, focusing on ease of use with minimal configuration, making it particularly valuable for developers building location-based services, recommendation systems, or local business discovery applications. What distinguishes this library is its low-friction approach to consuming the Yelp API, providing developers with a type-safe, modern C# implementation that handles the underlying HTTP communication and data mapping transparently. The primary target users are .NET developers seeking a reliable, lightweight solution for integrating rich local business data into web, mobile, or desktop applications.",
