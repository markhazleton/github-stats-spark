Log directory path\n  - Log file names\n  - Logging interval (seconds)\n  - Startup with Windows preference\n  - Idle detection settings\n  - Idle threshold (seconds)\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Building from Source\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/MarkHazleton/KeyPressCounter.git\n\n# Navigate to the project directory\ncd KeyPressCounter\n\n# Build the project\ndotnet build MWH.KeyPressCounter.csproj --configuration Release\n\n# Run the application\ndotnet run --project MWH.KeyPressCounter.csproj\n```\n\n### Dependencies\nThe project uses the following NuGet packages:\n- **SharpHook** (v7.1.0) - Global keyboard and mouse event hooking\n- **System.Management** (v10.0.0) - WMI access for hardware information\n- **System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter** (v10.0.0) - System performance metrics\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d How It Works\n\nKeyPressCounter combines several technologies to provide comprehensive monitoring:\n\n1. **Input Tracking**: Uses the [SharpHook](https://github.com/TolikPylypchuk/SharpHook) library (v7.1.0) with TaskPoolGlobalHook for efficient global keyboard and mouse event monitoring\n2. **Performance Monitoring**: Leverages Windows Performance Counters (System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter) for real-time system metrics including:\n   - CPU usage (Processor - % Processor Time)\n   - Memory availability (Memory - Available MBytes)\n   - System uptime (System - System Up Time)\n   - Disk I/O (PhysicalDisk - Bytes/sec)\n   - Network activity (Network Interface - Bytes Sent/Received per sec)\n3. **System Information**: Utilizes Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) via System.Management for hardware details:\n   - CPU name and specifications\n   - Total physical memory\n   - GPU information\n   - Drive space and configuration\n4. **Idle Detection**: Integrates with Windows User32.dll API using GetLastInputInfo for accurate user idle time calculation\n5. **Process Analysis**: Uses the .NET Process API to monitor and display top CPU and memory-consuming applications\n6. **Data Visualization**: Implements custom GDI+ drawing routines with anti-aliasing for smooth real-time performance graphs\n7. **Configuration Management**: JSON serialization for settings persistence with automatic Registry integration for Windows startup\n8. **Single Instance Enforcement**: Process enumeration to prevent multiple application instances\n\nAll data is processed through thread-safe Counter classes with proper locking mechanisms and displayed in an intuitive Windows Forms interface.\n\n## \ud83d\udd12 Privacy & Ethics\n\nKeyPressCounter is designed with privacy as a top priority:\n\n- **No Keystroke Content**: The application only counts keystrokes; it does not record which keys are pressed\n- **Local Storage Only**: All data remains on your local machine\n- **No Network Access**: The application does not transmit any data\n- **Transparent Operation**: All monitoring activities are clearly indicated\n\n### Important Notice\n\nWhen using this tool in organizational settings, ensure you:\n\n- Obtain explicit consent from users being monitored\n- Comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations\n- Use the data only for legitimate purposes such as ergonomic studies or productivity analysis\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
