    "ai_summary": "Based on the detailed README, here's a comprehensive technical summary of the GitHub repository:\n\nStats Spark is an advanced GitHub analytics and visualization platform designed to provide developers and teams with comprehensive insights into their GitHub activity and repository performance. The project leverages Python and integrates multiple cutting-edge technologies, including AI-powered analysis (using Claude Haiku), automated SVG generation, and interactive data visualization to transform raw GitHub data into actionable intelligence. \n\nThe system features a sophisticated analytics engine that generates multiple visualization types, including commit heatmaps, language statistics, activity streaks, and a unique \"Spark Score\" metric that quantifies developer productivity across consistency, volume, and collaboration dimensions. Key technical innovations include an intelligent repository ranking algorithm, AI-driven technical summaries, and a highly performant architecture that can analyze 50+ repositories in under 3 minutes while implementing smart caching and rate limit management.\n\nThe project stands out through its comprehensive approach to GitHub analytics, offering not just visualizations but deep insights powered by machine learning, with features like developer profiling, activity pattern recognition, and an interactive mobile-first dashboard. It employs modern web technologies like Chart.js for visualizations, supports multiple themes with WCAG AA accessibility, and uses GitHub Actions for automated daily updates.\n\nArchitecturally, the project emphasizes modularity, extensibility, and enterprise-readiness, with a flexible YAML-based configuration system, robust error handling, and support for local development and testing. The goal is to provide a turnkey solution for developers, team leaders, and open-source maintainers to gain deeper understanding of their GitHub ecosystem through intelligent, automated analysis and beautiful, shareable visualizations.",
