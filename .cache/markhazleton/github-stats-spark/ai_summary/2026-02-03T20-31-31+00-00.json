    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the GitHub repository:\n\nStats Spark is an advanced GitHub analytics platform designed to automatically generate comprehensive visualizations and insights about a developer's GitHub activity and repository ecosystem. The project leverages Python with AI-powered analysis capabilities, combining automated SVG generation, intelligent repository ranking, and interactive data visualization to provide developers with deep insights into their coding patterns, technology usage, and contribution metrics.\n\nThe core architecture is built around modular Python components that interface with the GitHub API, utilizing libraries like PyGithub for data retrieval and svgwrite for visualization generation. The system implements a sophisticated multi-tier analysis approach, featuring an AI-powered summary generation using Claude Haiku, intelligent caching mechanisms to optimize API request efficiency, and a comprehensive scoring algorithm that evaluates repositories across popularity, activity, and health dimensions.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Automated daily GitHub Actions workflow for statistics generation\n- Intelligent repository analysis with 97%+ AI summary accuracy\n- Mobile-first interactive dashboard with responsive design\n- Advanced caching and rate limit handling strategies\n- Extensible YAML-based configuration system\n- Comprehensive visualization of developer activity across multiple dimensions\n\nThe project targets multiple user personas, including individual developers seeking professional portfolio visualization, technical leaders performing productivity analysis, and open-source maintainers tracking project momentum. Its unique value proposition lies in its ability to transform raw GitHub data into actionable, visually compelling insights with minimal configuration effort.\n\nTechnologically, the project demonstrates a modern, cloud-native approach to developer analytics, combining serverless deployment, AI-assisted analysis, and adaptive visualization techniques to provide a comprehensive view of software development activities.",
