    "ai_summary": "Based on the comprehensive README, here's a detailed technical summary of the GitHub repository:\n\nStats Spark is an advanced GitHub analytics platform designed to automate and visualize developer activity and repository insights through intelligent data processing and AI-powered analysis. The project leverages Python as its primary language, integrating multiple technologies like PyGithub for GitHub data retrieval, svgwrite for visualization generation, and Claude Haiku AI for generating technical repository summaries. Its architecture emphasizes modular design, with a robust GitHub Actions workflow that automatically updates statistics daily, providing developers and teams with comprehensive, dynamically generated insights into coding patterns, repository health, and technical contributions.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Automated SVG profile statistics generation with a unique \"Spark Score\" metric\n- AI-powered repository analysis using enterprise-grade language models\n- Intelligent caching and rate-limit handling for GitHub API interactions\n- Mobile-first interactive dashboard with responsive, touch-optimized design\n- Comprehensive reporting with GitHub-flavored markdown and embedded visualizations\n\nThe project's innovative approach combines data visualization, machine learning, and GitHub metadata analysis to create a powerful tool for developers seeking deep insights into their coding activities. Its modular, extensible architecture and focus on performance (sub-3-minute analysis for 50+ repositories) make it a compelling solution for individual developers, technical leaders, and open-source maintainers looking to understand and showcase their technical contributions.",
