    "ai_summary": "Here's a detailed technical summary of the GitHub repository:\n\nStats Spark is a sophisticated GitHub analytics platform designed to automatically generate comprehensive insights and visualizations of a developer's GitHub activity. The project leverages Python as its primary language, with a multi-faceted approach to repository analysis that combines automated SVG generation, AI-powered technical summaries, and an interactive web dashboard. \n\nThe core architecture is built around modular Python scripts that interface with the GitHub API using PyGithub, with intelligent caching and rate limit management. The system generates multiple types of visualizations including commit heatmaps, language usage statistics, and activity streaks, powered by libraries like svgwrite and requests. A unique feature is the \"Spark Score\" - a composite metric that evaluates developer activity across consistency, volume, and collaboration dimensions.\n\nThe AI-powered analysis component integrates Claude Haiku for generating intelligent repository summaries, implementing a sophisticated three-tier fallback mechanism to ensure high-quality technical insights. The interactive dashboard is constructed using a mobile-first JavaScript approach with Chart.js for visualizations, featuring responsive design, touch-optimized interactions, and comprehensive filtering capabilities.\n\nKey technical innovations include:\n- Automated daily GitHub Actions workflow for profile updates\n- Intelligent repository ranking algorithm\n- AI-generated technical summaries with 97%+ accuracy\n- Performance-optimized API request handling\n- WCAG 2.1 AA accessible visualizations\n- Comprehensive developer profiling with technology diversity analysis\n\nThe project is particularly noteworthy for its comprehensive approach to GitHub activity analysis, providing developers, teams, and technical leaders with deep insights into coding patterns, repository health, and individual development trajectories.",
