    "ai_summary": "Based on the detailed README, here's a comprehensive technical summary of the github-stats-spark repository:\n\nStats Spark is an advanced GitHub analytics platform designed to automatically generate comprehensive profile statistics and repository insights using Python, SVG visualization, and AI-powered analysis. The project combines automated data collection from GitHub's API with intelligent processing to create multi-dimensional visualizations and technical reports, featuring a modular architecture that supports detailed repository analysis, personalized developer profiling, and interactive dashboards.\n\nKey technical highlights include:\n- Comprehensive data generation across multiple statistical categories (commit heatmaps, language usage, activity patterns)\n- AI-driven technical repository summaries using Claude Haiku with a 97% success rate\n- Intelligent caching and API rate limit management\n- Highly customizable YAML-based configuration\n- Mobile-first interactive dashboard with responsive design\n- Performance-optimized data processing (<3 minutes for 50+ repositories)\n\nThe technology stack leverages Python for core processing, with dependencies like PyGithub for GitHub interaction, svgwrite for visualization, and integration with AI services. The project implements advanced architectural patterns including modular design, intelligent caching strategies, and automated GitHub Actions workflows for continuous updates.\n\nUnique innovations include the \"Spark Score\" - a proprietary 0-100 metric combining developer consistency, commit volume, and collaboration signals, and an AI-powered repository ranking algorithm that weighs popularity, activity, and project health across multiple dimensions.\n\nThe project is particularly valuable for developers seeking professional GitHub profile visualization, technical leaders wanting comprehensive contribution insights, and open-source maintainers tracking project momentum and community engagement.",
