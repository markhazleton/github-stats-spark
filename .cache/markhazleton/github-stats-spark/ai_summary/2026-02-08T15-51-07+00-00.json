    "ai_summary": "Based on the comprehensive README and repository details, here's a detailed technical summary:\n\nStats Spark is a sophisticated GitHub analytics platform designed to generate automated, AI-powered insights and visualizations for developer profiles and repositories. The project leverages Python as its primary language, integrating multiple technologies like PyGithub for GitHub data retrieval, svgwrite for visualization generation, and AI services (Claude Haiku) for intelligent repository analysis. \n\nThe platform offers a multi-faceted approach to GitHub statistics, featuring automated SVG profile visualizations across five key categories: overview dashboard, commit heatmap, language statistics, streaks/consistency tracking, and \"fun stats\". Its unique value proposition includes an innovative \"Spark Score\" algorithm that evaluates developer activity through consistency, volume, and collaboration metrics. The system is engineered with enterprise-grade considerations like smart caching, rate limit handling, and comprehensive configuration options via YAML.\n\nA standout feature is the AI-powered repository analysis, which generates comprehensive markdown reports using a sophisticated ranking algorithm that weighs repository popularity (30%), activity (45%), and health signals (25%). The architecture supports automatic daily updates through GitHub Actions, intelligent API request optimization, and generates technical summaries with a claimed 97% success rate.\n\nThe project demonstrates a modern, modular design emphasizing performance, accessibility, and user experience. It targets developers, technical leaders, and open-source maintainers seeking data-driven insights into their GitHub ecosystem. The interactive dashboard, built with mobile-first principles, offers responsive design, touch-optimized interfaces, and advanced features like repository comparison and export functionality.\n\nTechnologically, Stats Spark represents a comprehensive solution combining data retrieval (PyGithub), visualization (svgwrite), AI integration, and web technologies (JavaScript, CSS) to create a powerful GitHub analytics platform. Its extensible architecture, focus on automated insights, and sophisticated analysis make it a noteworthy tool for developers seeking to understand and showcase their coding activities.",
