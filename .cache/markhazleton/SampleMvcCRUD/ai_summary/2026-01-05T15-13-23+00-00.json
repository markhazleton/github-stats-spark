    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary for the SampleMvcCRUD repository:\n\nThis is a comprehensive .NET 10 web application demonstrating multiple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation strategies for employee and department management, serving as both a reference architecture and educational resource. The project showcases diverse UI patterns including traditional MVC, Razor Pages, and Single Page Application (SPA) approaches, with robust features like Bootswatch theme switching, REST API endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI enabled), and flexible data layer implementations using Entity Framework Core. Architecturally, the solution emphasizes clean architecture principles, dependency injection, and modular design, featuring separate projects for domain models, repositories, and testing, while supporting multiple deployment targets including Windows IIS, Azure App Service, and containerized Docker environments. The repository is particularly notable for its progressive modernization approach, incrementally adopting latest .NET technologies, enhancing UI/UX with Bootstrap 5, and implementing sophisticated patterns like repository/service abstractions and dynamic theme management. Primarily targeted at .NET developers, software architects, and technical learners seeking a comprehensive, production-ready reference implementation of modern web application development techniques, the project offers a living, continuously evolving template for building maintainable, scalable enterprise web solutions.",
