    "ai_summary": "This repository is an ASP.NET Core 6 MVC web application designed as an administrative product management system for a fictional company called Carved Rock. The application demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of modern .NET web development practices, featuring full CRUD functionality for products and categories with robust authentication using ASP.NET Identity, SQLite database persistence via Entity Framework Core, and advanced validation using FluentValidation. The project showcases key architectural patterns including dependency injection, repository pattern, and domain logic separation, while providing a clean, Bootstrap-styled user interface with self-registration capabilities and automatic data reset for experimentation. Technically sophisticated, the application serves as an educational reference for developers learning ASP.NET Core MVC, demonstrating best practices in web application design, including model validation, authentication, data access, and UI rendering. It would be particularly valuable for .NET developers looking to understand modern web development techniques, serving as both a learning resource and a potential starter template for similar administrative or inventory management applications.",
