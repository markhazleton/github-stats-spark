    "ai_summary": "Based on the detailed README and repository overview, here's a comprehensive technical summary:\n\nTaskListProcessor is an advanced .NET 10.0 library designed for sophisticated asynchronous task orchestration and processing, targeting enterprise-grade applications that require complex, resilient, and high-performance concurrent operation management. The library provides a comprehensive framework for managing asynchronous workflows with built-in features like circuit breakers, dependency injection, advanced scheduling, and extensive telemetry through OpenTelemetry integration, enabling developers to build fault-tolerant systems with granular control over task execution, prioritization, and error handling. Key architectural strengths include native .NET dependency injection support, strongly-typed result handling, pluggable cross-cutting concerns using the decorator pattern, and sophisticated task scheduling strategies that support dependency resolution, priority-based execution, and intelligent load balancing. Unique differentiators include its focus on type safety, enterprise observability, and a developer-friendly approach that implements advanced distributed systems patterns while maintaining clean, maintainable code through interface segregation and SOLID design principles.\n\nThe library is particularly well-suited for microservice architectures, distributed computing scenarios, and complex backend systems requiring sophisticated task coordination, such as data aggregation pipelines, multi-step business processes, and high-concurrency enterprise applications where predictable, observable, and resilient asynchronous processing is critical.",
