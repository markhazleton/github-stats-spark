    "ai_summary": "Based on the repository details and README, here's a comprehensive technical summary:\n\nTaskListProcessor is a sophisticated .NET 10.0 library designed to solve complex asynchronous task orchestration challenges in enterprise-level applications, providing a robust framework for managing concurrent, distributed operations with advanced resilience and observability features. The library implements enterprise-grade patterns including dependency injection, circuit breakers, and intelligent task scheduling, enabling developers to build high-performance, fault-tolerant systems that can efficiently coordinate multiple asynchronous operations like API calls, database queries, and microservice interactions. Leveraging modern .NET capabilities, it offers type-safe, strongly-typed results with comprehensive telemetry through OpenTelemetry integration, native dependency injection support, and sophisticated scheduling strategies that enable priority-based, dependency-aware task execution with automatic failure detection and prevention. Key architectural differentiators include its focus on SOLID principles, pluggable cross-cutting concerns via decorator pattern, thread-safe concurrent processing, and a flexible, extensible design that supports advanced scenarios like streaming results, load balancing, and granular error categorization. The library is particularly well-suited for complex distributed systems, microservices architectures, and high-throughput applications requiring sophisticated async coordination, with a developer-friendly approach that emphasizes type safety, performance, and comprehensive observability. Target users include enterprise software architects, backend developers working on complex distributed systems, and teams building scalable, resilient microservice-based applications that demand advanced async processing capabilities.",
