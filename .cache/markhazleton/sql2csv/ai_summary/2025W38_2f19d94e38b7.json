    "ai_summary": "SQL2CSV is a comprehensive .NET 9 toolkit designed to simplify SQLite database exploration, transformation, and code generation, offering developers a versatile utility for database metadata analysis and data extraction. The project provides a multi-modal approach to database interaction through both a CLI (command-line interface) and an early-stage web UI, enabling users to discover SQLite databases, export table data to CSV, generate schema reports in multiple formats (text/JSON/markdown), and automatically create C# Data Transfer Object (DTO) classes from database schemas. Built with modern .NET technologies and following clean architecture principles, the toolkit leverages dependency injection, structured logging, and modular service design to provide a robust, extensible solution for database introspection and data migration tasks. Key differentiators include its parallel processing capabilities, cross-platform compatibility, intelligent database discovery engine, and built-in error recovery mechanisms, making it particularly valuable for developers, data analysts, and engineers who need to quickly extract, transform, or analyze SQLite database structures. The project supports advanced features like multi-table filtering, dynamic table analysis, and configurable export options, positioning it as a powerful tool for scenarios involving database exploration, migration, documentation, and code generation.",
