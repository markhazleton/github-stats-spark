    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary of Slurper:\n\nSlurper is a dynamic data extraction library for .NET that provides a unified, zero-configuration approach to parsing and transforming structured data formats (XML, JSON, CSV, and HTML) into easily consumable C# objects without requiring explicit type declarations. The library leverages dynamic object capabilities and a flexible extraction mechanism that allows developers to access complex nested data structures using intuitive property navigation, effectively eliminating the traditional overhead of manual model mapping and parsing. Built with modern .NET frameworks (targeting .NET 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0), Slurper implements an extensible architecture that supports async operations, dependency injection, and a plugin system for custom data extractors, making it particularly useful for scenarios involving data integration, web scraping, and rapid prototype development. Its key differentiator is the ability to work with heterogeneous data sources through a consistent API, enabling developers to extract and manipulate data with minimal boilerplate code and without predefining complex object models. The library follows best practices in software design, including semantic versioning, comprehensive error handling, built-in logging support, and a factory-based approach for creating extractors, which provides a clean and intuitive developer experience for working with structured data across multiple formats.\n\nTarget Users:\n- .NET developers working with diverse data sources\n- Data integration specialists\n- Web scraping and data extraction professionals\n- Developers seeking rapid prototyping solutions",
