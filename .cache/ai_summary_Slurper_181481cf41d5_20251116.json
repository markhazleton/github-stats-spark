    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary for Slurper:\n\nSlurper is a sophisticated .NET data extraction library designed to simplify parsing and transforming structured data across multiple formats (XML, JSON, CSV, HTML) into dynamically accessible C# objects without requiring explicit type declarations. The library leverages dynamic object capabilities and provides a unified, intuitive API for extracting and navigating complex data structures, eliminating the traditional overhead of manual model creation and verbose parsing code. Architecturally, Slurper employs a factory pattern with extensible extractors, supports dependency injection, and offers advanced features like async processing, comprehensive error handling, and a plugin system for custom data extractors. Its core innovation lies in using an enhanced ExpandoObject-like mechanism that enables developers to access nested data through simple dot notation without predefining strongly-typed models, making it particularly valuable for scenarios involving complex, schema-variable data sources like configuration files, API responses, or heterogeneous data ingestion. The library targets .NET developers working with diverse data formats who desire a more flexible, low-friction approach to data transformation, with built-in support for modern .NET versions (8.0, 9.0, 10.0) and a clean, performance-oriented design. Slurper distinguishes itself through its zero-configuration approach, comprehensive format support, and emphasis on developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code typically associated with data parsing and object mapping.",
