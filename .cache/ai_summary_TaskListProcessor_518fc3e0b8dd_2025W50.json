    "ai_summary": "Based on the comprehensive README and repository details, here's a technical summary of TaskListProcessor:\n\nTaskListProcessor is an advanced .NET 10.0 library designed to solve complex asynchronous task orchestration challenges in enterprise-grade applications, providing a robust framework for managing concurrent, interdependent operations with high resilience and performance. The library implements sophisticated enterprise patterns including circuit breakers, dependency injection, and advanced scheduling, enabling developers to build fault-tolerant systems with comprehensive telemetry and observability through native OpenTelemetry integration. Its architecture emphasizes type safety, modular design, and pluggable cross-cutting concerns, supporting parallel task processing with configurable concurrency limits, priority-based execution, and intelligent dependency resolution using techniques like topological sorting. Key differentiators include its native .NET dependency injection support, decorator pattern implementation, and first-class support for streaming results, making it particularly valuable for microservice architectures, distributed systems, and high-throughput applications requiring sophisticated async coordination. The project is meticulously documented with extensive learning paths, tutorials, and a focus on developer experience, targeting intermediate to advanced .NET developers working on complex, performance-critical systems that demand resilient and observable async processing capabilities.",
