    "ai_summary": "Based on the README and repository details, here's a comprehensive technical summary:\n\nTaskListProcessor is an advanced .NET 10.0 library designed for sophisticated asynchronous task orchestration and processing, targeting enterprise-grade applications with complex distributed computing requirements. The library provides a comprehensive framework for managing concurrent, fault-tolerant operations through sophisticated features like circuit breakers, dependency injection, priority-based scheduling, and rich telemetry integration using OpenTelemetry. Its architecture emphasizes SOLID principles, offering developers a robust, type-safe mechanism for coordinating multiple asynchronous tasks with granular control over execution, including parallel processing, individual task timeout management, and intelligent failure isolation. Key differentiators include native .NET dependency injection support, enterprise-level observability, advanced scheduling strategies, and a focus on performance optimization through techniques like thread-safe concurrent collections and efficient memory management. The project is particularly suited for microservices, distributed systems, and high-throughput applications requiring complex task coordination, with a design that prioritizes resilience, extensibility, and developer experience through comprehensive documentation and intuitive APIs.\n\nKey technical highlights:\n- Language/Framework: C#, .NET 10.0\n- Primary Patterns: Circuit Breaker, Dependency Injection, Task Orchestration\n- Core Capabilities: Parallel Processing, Fault Tolerance, Rich Telemetry\n- Target Use Cases: Microservices, Distributed Systems, Enterprise Applications",
