    "ai_summary": "InquirySpark is a .NET 10-based survey and inquiry management system designed with a strong emphasis on immutability and read-only data persistence, utilizing SQLite databases and an MVC architecture. The solution provides a comprehensive admin interface built with Bootstrap 5 and DataTables, enabling users to interact with survey data through a structured, type-safe application that enforces strict data integrity and prevents unintended modifications. Leveraging modern .NET technologies like Entity Framework Core 10, the project implements a multi-project solution with clear separation of concerns across repositories, common libraries, and administrative interfaces, while maintaining a robust configuration and dependency injection approach. The system's unique architectural design centers on read-only SQLite databases, eliminating the need for traditional SQL Server infrastructure and providing a lightweight, portable data management solution that can be easily distributed and deployed. Primarily targeted at organizations and developers seeking a flexible, lightweight survey management system with strong data governance and a modern web interface, InquirySpark demonstrates advanced .NET development practices, including nullable reference types, comprehensive testing, and automated build processes. The project stands out for its emphasis on immutability, clean architecture, and comprehensive documentation, making it an excellent reference implementation for .NET survey and data management applications.",
