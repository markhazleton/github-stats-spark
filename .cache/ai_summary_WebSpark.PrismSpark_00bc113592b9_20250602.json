    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nWebSpark.PrismSpark is a high-performance C# library designed to provide syntax highlighting and code rendering capabilities for multiple programming languages, serving as a .NET-native port of the popular PrismJS JavaScript library. The project offers a comprehensive tokenization and highlighting system supporting over 20 programming languages, with advanced features like plugin extensibility, theme management, and sophisticated rendering options through dependency injection and modular architecture. Key technological components include an event-driven hook system, async processing capabilities, custom grammar definitions, and seamless integration with ASP.NET web frameworks, enabling developers to easily implement rich code presentation in web applications and documentation platforms. The library distinguishes itself through its robust plugin ecosystem, flexible theming infrastructure, and performance-oriented design, which allows for efficient code parsing, caching, and rendering across various .NET environments. Its architectural approach emphasizes modularity, with clear separation of concerns between highlighting engines, theme managers, and plugin systems, making it highly extensible and adaptable to different project requirements. Primarily targeting .NET developers, web application builders, documentation generators, and technical content platforms, PrismSpark provides a comprehensive, developer-friendly solution for transforming raw code into visually appealing, syntax-highlighted representations.",
