    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the supermarket-api repository:\n\nThe supermarket-api is a RESTful ASP.NET Core web API demonstrating best practices for building scalable, maintainable microservices for supermarket inventory management. Leveraging .NET 8, Entity Framework Core, and AutoMapper, the project provides a clean, decoupled architecture for managing product categories and inventory with features like pagination, filtering, and Swagger-based API documentation. The API follows domain-driven design principles, utilizing repository and service patterns to abstract data access and business logic, and supports in-memory and potentially external database providers for flexible data persistence. Key technical highlights include robust error handling, standardized API responses, immutable record types for resources, and comprehensive configuration for routing and validation. This project serves as an educational reference and starter template for developers looking to implement modern, production-ready .NET web APIs with clean code practices and contemporary architectural patterns.",
