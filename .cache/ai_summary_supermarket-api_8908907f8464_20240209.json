    "ai_summary": "Technical Summary:\n\nThe Supermarket API is a comprehensive RESTful web service built with ASP.NET Core and .NET 8, designed to demonstrate best practices in building maintainable and decoupled API architectures for managing supermarket-related data. The project leverages modern .NET technologies including Entity Framework Core for data access, AutoMapper for object mapping, and Swagger for API documentation, implementing a clean, modular approach to API development with support for operations like product and category management. Its architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, utilizing repository patterns, dependency injection, and implementing features such as pagination, filtering, and in-memory database testing capabilities. The API is particularly notable for its iterative development approach, with multiple version updates that showcase progressive refinement of .NET ecosystem practices, including adopting nullable types, record types, and modern C# language features. While serving as an educational reference for ASP.NET Core API development, the project provides a robust template for developers looking to build scalable, well-structured web services with comprehensive documentation and extensible design principles.",
