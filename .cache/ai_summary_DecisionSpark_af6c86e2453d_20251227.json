    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the DecisionSpark repository:\n\nDecisionSpark is an innovative .NET 10-based decision routing engine that leverages a conversation-driven approach to guide users through intelligent decision-making processes using minimal, context-aware questioning. The application implements a flexible, configuration-driven system that combines RESTful APIs, Razor Pages, and AI-powered natural language processing to dynamically generate and evaluate decision paths across various domains, such as activity planning or technology stack selection.\n\nThe project's core architecture is built around a modular, service-oriented design that separates concerns into distinct components like SessionStore, RoutingEvaluator, TraitParser, and OpenAIService, enabling extensible and configurable decision logic through JSON-based specifications. It integrates OpenAI's language models to generate intelligent questions, parse responses, and derive contextual traits, allowing the system to adaptively navigate complex decision trees with minimal user input while maintaining a sophisticated rule-based evaluation mechanism.\n\nKey technical highlights include multi-type question support (text, single-select, multi-select), session management through file-based persistence, structured logging with Serilog, comprehensive API documentation via Swagger/OpenAPI, and a flexible configuration approach that allows defining decision rules without code modifications. The system is designed with scalability and adaptability in mind, supporting various use cases from family activity planning to technical consultations.\n\nThe project demonstrates advanced .NET development practices, incorporating modern web technologies, AI integration, and a clean, modular architectural approach that emphasizes configurability, intelligent routing, and user-friendly interaction. Its unique value proposition lies in its ability to transform complex decision-making processes into intuitive, conversational experiences powered by configurable rules and AI-enhanced natural language processing.\n\nPotential users include developers, product managers, consultants, and organizations seeking a flexible framework for building intelligent, conversation-driven decision support systems across multiple domains, with easy customization and extension capabilities.",
