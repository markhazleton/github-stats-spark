    "ai_summary": "Here's a comprehensive technical summary of the DecisionSpark repository:\n\nDecisionSpark is an innovative .NET 10-based decision routing engine that provides an intelligent, conversation-driven approach to guided decision-making through configurable rule-based interactions. The framework enables users to navigate complex decision trees by asking minimal, strategically designed questions while leveraging advanced technologies like OpenAI for natural language processing and dynamic question generation. Its key architectural strengths include a flexible, config-driven design that allows creating decision workflows through JSON specifications without code modifications, supporting multiple question types and intelligent routing mechanisms.\n\nThe project implements a sophisticated microservice-like architecture with modular components such as a Session Store, Routing Evaluator, Trait Parser, and OpenAI integration, enabling dynamic conversational experiences across various domains like family planning, technology stack selection, and recommendation systems. By combining RESTful API endpoints, interactive Razor Pages web interface, and extensible configuration management, DecisionSpark offers a powerful platform for creating intelligent, context-aware decision support systems that can adapt to complex scenarios with minimal manual intervention.\n\nTechnically, the application leverages cutting-edge .NET technologies, including Razor Pages for web interfaces, OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation, Serilog for structured logging, and potentially Azure or OpenAI services for natural language capabilities. The design emphasizes modularity, configurability, and separation of concerns, with a pluggable architecture that supports easy extension and customization of decision logic through JSON-based specifications.\n\nKey differentiators include its ability to generate contextually relevant questions, parse and derive traits from user responses, and provide intelligent routing with tie-breaking mechanisms, all while maintaining a clean, configuration-driven approach that minimizes hard-coded logic. The framework is particularly suited for developers and organizations seeking a flexible, AI-enhanced decision support tool that can be rapidly adapted to various decision-making scenarios.\n\nThe project's comprehensive documentation, clear architectural diagrams, and well-structured README demonstrate a professional approach to software design, making it an attractive solution for teams looking to implement intelligent, conversational decision support systems with minimal complexity and maximum adaptability.",
